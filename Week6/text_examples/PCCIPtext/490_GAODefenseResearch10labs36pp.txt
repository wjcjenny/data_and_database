The Honorabl e John Gl e nn Chai r man, Commi t tee on Governmental Affai r s Uni t ed States Senate Dear Mr. Chai r man: Thi s report responds to your request that we exami n e securi t y control s at government and contractor l a boratori e s engaged i n the chemi c al warfare and bi o l o gi c al defense research program for the Department of Defense (DOD). In parti c ul a r, you asked that we exami n e the adequacy of control s over forei g n vi s i t ors, techni c al data, and sensi t i v e chemi c al and bi o l o gi c al materi a l s at DOD and contractor l a boratori e s, as wel l as the securi t y over the shi p ment of these materi a l s . Thi s report summari z es the resul t s of our exami n ati o n of fi v e DOD and fi v e contractor l a boratori e s and di s cusses three areas of concern. Our work di d not address broader securi t y i s sues such as government-wi d e control s over techni c al data, i n formal communi c ati o ns among sci e nti s ts, or U.S. sci e nti s ts travel i n g overseas. Except as noted, our work al s o di d not address control weaknesses that mi g ht have exi s ted before 1989. As requested, we provi d ed detai l e d bri e fi n gs to your staff. At the ti m e of our revi e w, securi t y control s at the 10 l a boratori e s we exami n ed and shi p pi n g procedures i n vol v i n g the l a boratori e s were general l y suffi c i e nt to protect sensi t i v e speci a l materi a l s and techni c al data. However, we noted that some control s shoul d be i m proved to mi n i m i z e the chance of compromi s i n g sensi t i v e data or materi a l s at the l a boratori e s Speci f i c al l y , we found the fol l o wi n g: 9 The Army' s Medi c al Research and Devel o pment Command di d not al w ays compl y wi t h the DOD requi r ement that authori z ati o n requests for forei g n representati v es vi s i t i n g Army faci l i t i e s be submi t ted at l e ast 30 days before the proposed vi s i t s. The 30-day requi r ement i s based pri mari l y on reci p roci t y wi t h other countri e s and the need for coordi n ati o n and preparati o n. . The Chemi c al Personnel Rel i a bi l i t y Program does not (1) check the credi t records of i n di v i d ual s assi g ned to the program or (2) consol i d ate and report i n formati o n to properl y oversee the program-for exampl e ,

Informati o n we obtai n ed from the Medi c al Command shows that the l a ck of ti m el y approval of proposed forei g n vi s i t ors has been a probl e m for several years.

An i n formati o n paper dated February 12, 1987, refers to a reported i n crease i n the number of unauthori z ed forei g n vi s i t ors and the need to compl y wi t h Army regul a ti o ns.

The GAO found that one of the Center s off-si t e contractors had a document accountabi l i t y system for two speci a l access contracts, but some cl a ssi f i e d materi a l stored i n a safe had not been properl y marked or added to the accountabi l i t y system, as of December 1989. GAO expl a i n ed that document accountabi l i t y systems are to control and account for cl a ssi f i e d documents. The GAO further expl a i n ed that, when a cl a ssi f i e d document is created or recei v ed, a record is establ i s hed showi n g the uni q ue i d enti f yi n g number assi g ned to it, date of ori g i n or recei p t, creator, l e vel of cl a ssi f i c ati o n, and bri e f descri p ti o n of the document. The GAO added that the record may al s o i n di c ate the name of the custodi a n where the document is stored. Accordi n g to the GAO, if the document is transferred, downgraded, decl a ssi f i e d, or destroyed, the accountabi l i t y record is annotated to show the date and method of di s posi t i o n. The GAO expl a i n ed the accountabi l i t y records are used to veri f y the exi s tence of the documents. (p. 2, p. 5, pp 1%17/GAO Draft Report)
