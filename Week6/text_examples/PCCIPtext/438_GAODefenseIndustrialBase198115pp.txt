REPORT OF THE DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL BASE PANEL OF THE COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 96th CONGRESS, 2nd SESSION, December 31, 1980. This panel concluded that there has been a serious decline in the nation's defense industrial capability that endangers our national security. Also, that the combination of an erosion of industrial elements and an increasing dependence on foreign sources for critical materials endangers the foundation of our defense posture. Major findings include: or an adequate base prepared-

--DOD does not have an on-going program plan to address the defense industrial ness issue, --present DOD procurement to the government, and procedures

are disadvantageous

--current tax and profit policies discourage capital investment in new technology which would be advantageous to the defense industrial base. A number of legislative are made. They include: and non-legislative recommendations
