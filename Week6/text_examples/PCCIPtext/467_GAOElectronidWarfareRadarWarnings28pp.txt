B-206648 July 1, 1987 The Honorable Caspar W. Weinberger The Secretary of Defense Dear Mr. Secretary: On April 28,1987, we testified at a hearing before the Subcommittee on Legislation and National Security, House Committee on Government Operations, on the Air Force' s and the Navy' s radar warning receiver (RWR) programs. (See app. I.) Our testimony focused on the . lack of response by the Department of Defense (DOD) to prior recommendations for achieving commonality in RWR acquisition programs, continuing proliferation of Air Force and Navy RWRS, and adverse effects stemming from concurrent production and testing of
RWRS.

Nonresponsiveness to Prior Recommendations and Continuing Proliferation

We reviewed DOD'S attempt to merge the Navy' s ALR-67 program and the Air Force' s ALR-69 upgrade' program and testified in related congressional hearings in 1982. Our prior report2 and the House Committee on Government Operations report3 recommended several actions for overcoming obstacles to the merger and for otherwise promoting commonality in RWR programs. Our recent review showed that these recommendations have not been implemented, with the Air Force and the Navy continuing their separate programs and otherwise continuing the proliferation of RWRS. Also, the Air Force has started a program to improve the ALR-69, currently installed in all F-16 aircraft, estimated to cost over $500 million. The Navy has started an ALR-67 improvement program, estimated to cost over $1.3 billion. Both services are acquiring nine different RWRS for existing tactical aircraft at an estimated cost of over $6.6 billion. None are common to both Air Force and Navy aircraft, and seven of them have entered development or production since the 1982 hearings.

` Air Force' s ALR-69 upgrade program is now designated the ALR-74. ` Lack of Cooperation Precludes Navy And Air Force From Developing Common Radar Warning Receivers (June 11, 1982, GAO/C--82-38). 3Failure of the Air Force and Navy to Develop Common Radar Warning Receivers is Costly (Aug. 12, 1982, House of Representatives, House Report 97-728).

The services have not capitalized on several opportunities to develop common RwRs. In particular, the Air Force chose to acquire different RIVXS for its F-15, F-16, and F-111 au-craft despite the opportunity for a common RWFd being pointed out by Air Force technical elements. The main problem in achieving commonality seems to be a procurement process led by service preferences and the perpetual updating of unique systems. Each service believes that its concept for a system is best and will oppose compromise of its design or performance gods. @MX? an RWR hasl been developed, the only alternative seriously considered when improvements are needed is an update of that RWR or a new serviceunique system. The services' main argument against changing to a common system was the cost involved in the aircraft wiring adjustments to accommodate a replacement RWR. non' s policy requires an economic analysis of program alternatives before resource commitments. Such an analysis, in our opinion, should consider not only the cost of wiring adjustments, but also the potential savings that could result from a program alternative achieving commonality. We found, however, that the service analyses done in justifying their RWR programs did not consider the cost benefits of commonality. We believe that a common RWR is feasible. The numerous RWRS perform a common function and face a common threat. With required interfaces, a common RWR could be developed for use on different tactical aircraft. Despite the importance of adequately testing weapon systems before producing them, we found that the Air Force' s and the Navy' s RWR programs are marked by widespread concurrency and that this acquisition strategy has resulted in adverse consequences. On one program, the Air Force contracted for system support equipment costing $17.6 million before testing the RWR. Subsequent testing on the RWR resulted in deferring its production pending redesign. The support equipment can no longer be used with the redesigned RWR, and Air Force officials are uncertain how it will be used. On another program, the Air Force started producing the RWR before beginning its testing. Later testing showed that the new RWR'S performance was worse than that of the RWR it was to replace. The Air Force

RWR,

placing it in storage pending rede-

Subsequently, the Air Force started installing the RWR in aircraft even though its performance is still considered operationally unsuitable. Similarly, the Navy started to produce an RWR while testing was underway. The testing revealed serious deficiencies. Nevertheless, the Navy continued production and in February 198' 7 contracted for the last of its total program quantity for the RWR. As of March 1987, the Navy had made no further operational testing of the RWR and thus bought its total program requirement, in our opinion, without assurance that its performance will be satisfactory. The Navy started production of another RWR before beginning its operational testing. In two subsequent attempts to test the RWR, it performed so poorly that testing was curtailed. Nevertheless, the Navy has continued production and is installing the RWR in operational aircraft while its performance deficiencies remain unresolved. Despite these experiences, the Air Force plans to start producing another RWR before completing its testing. We recommend that the Secretary of Defense (1) select the best RWR, based on cost and effectiveness, for maximum common use on existing Air Force and Navy tactical aircraft and (2) stop those RWR programs that cannot be demonstrated as cost effective. To ensure selection of the best RWR, we also recommend that cost-effectiveness analyses performed should not be restricted to short-term cost, but should consider the lifecycle costs, including expected savings to result from commonality. We further recommend that, until selection of the common RWR, the Secretary of Defense slow production and delay further contract awards for RWRS until operational tests provide reasonable assurance that their performance will be satisfactory . We reviewed the acquisition programs for those RWRS used in or planned for existing Air Force and Navy tactical aircraft. We examined program documents, directives, analyses, test reports, and other records bearing on the issues We also discussed various aspects of our work with responsible DOD, Air Force, Navy, and contractor representatives.

MR. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE: I AM PLEASED TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY TO DISCUSS OUR REVIEW OF
S THE AIR FORCE'

AND THE NAVY'S RADAR WARNING RECEIVER (RwR) REQUEST, THE CHAIRMAN ASKED US TO

PROGRAMS. IN A FEBRUARY 6, 1986,

REVIEW THE PROGRAMSTO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY WERE STRUCTURED TO ENHANCE COMMON-SERVICE USE. OUR REVIEW INCLUDED UPDATING FORMERLY KNOWN

INFORMATION ON THE ALR-74 RWR PROGRAM. THE ALR-74, AS THE ALR 67,'69,

WAS THE SUBJECT OF HEARINGS BEFORE THIS THAT BEARING ADDRESSED JOINT-SERVICE EFFORTS

SUBCOMMITTEE IN 1982.

AND COMPLIANCE WITH CONGRESSIONAL AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) GUIDANCE ON ACHIEVING COMMONALITY IN RWR DEVELOPMENT.

AS ALSO REQUESTED, WE EXAMINED (1) WHETHER DOD WAS FOLLOWING THE PRACTICE OF CONCURRENTTESTING AND PRODUCTION AND (2) WHETHER THE RWRs WERE COMBAT EFFECTIVE.

BACKGROUND RWRs ARE USED IN MILITARY AIRCRAFT TO ALERT AIRCREWS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DETECTED BY ENEMY RADAR-CONTROLLED WEAPONS. AS SHOWN IN FIGURE 1.1, RWRs ACCOMPLISH THIS BY SENSING THE SIGNALS FROM THREAT

RADARS, PROVIDING AN AUDIO WARNING SIGNAL, AND DISPLAYING THE WARNING INFORMATION ON A VIDEO SCREEN IN THE AIRCRAFT COCKPIT. THE

VIDEO DISPLAY AND AUDIO SIGNAL IDENTIFY THE THREATS, PROVIDE THEIR LOCATIONS OR RELATIVE BEARINGS, AND RANK THE THREATS IN ORDER OF DANGER TO THE AIRCRAFT. 2

CURRENTLY, THE AIR FORCE AND NAVY HAVE 13 DIFFERENT RWRs IN USE OR BEING ACQUIRED FOR TACTICAL AIRCRAFT. EXPENDITURES FOR THOSE STILL BILLION

CONGRESSIONAL CONCERNFOR COMMONALITY AS MEMBERS OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE ARE AWARE, THE CONGRESSHAS FOR SOME TIME BEEN CONCERNEDWITH THE NEED FOR REDUCING PROLIFERATION AND ACHIEVING COMMONALITY IN SERVICE PROGRAMS. CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES HAVE FREQUENTLY EMPHASIZED THE NEED TO AVOID DUPLICATION IN SERVICE PROGRAMS, IMPROVE THE READINESS OF OUR FORCES, AND REDUCE COSTS BY DEVELOPING SYSTEMS THAT COULD MEET INTERSERVICE NEEDS.

ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HAS VOICED ITS CONCERNS ABOUT THE LACK OF COMMONALITY IN ELECTRONIC WARFARE PROGRAMS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 1985 FOLLOWING HEARINGS ON RADAR JAMMER PROGRAMS, THE SUBCOMMITTEE CONCLUDEDTHAT SOME PROGRAMSWERE CONTINUING A PATTERN OF UNWARRANTED PROLIFERATION AND RECOMMENDED ACTIONS TO FOSTER COMMONALIT?E. 4

MR. CHAIRMAN, AS YOU WILL RECALL, WE REVIEWED THE ATTEMPT TO MERGE THESE TWO PROGRAMSAND TESTIFIED SUBCOMMITTEE IN 1982. IN RELATED HEARINGS BEFORE THIS

WE FOUND THAT THE AIR FORCE AND THE NAVY,

CONTRARY TO DOD GUIDANCE, DID NOT COOPERATE AND CONTINUED THEIR SEPARATE PROGRAMS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE AIR FORCE ESTABLISHED A JOINT AIR FORCE AND NAVY ALR-74 PROGRAMOFFICE, AND THE NAVY ASSIGNED A REPRESENTATIVE TO THE OFFICE WHO NEVER REPORTED.

IN ADDITION,

THE NAVY AND THE AIR FORCE DISAGREED ON THE BEST

--

THE AIR FORCE AND THE NAVY HAVE CONTINUED THEIR SEPARATE ALR-74 AND ALR-67 PROGRAMS, RESPECTIVELY.

--

DOD HAS MADE NO FURTHER EFFORT TO ESTABLISH A JOINT PROGRAM OFFICE OR TO DEVELOP A PLAN FOR A COMMON, NEAR-TERM RWR.

--

AN ADVISORY GROUP TO RESOLVE DISPUTES HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED, AND THE DISPUTE OVER TECHNOLOGYSTILL LINGERS. THE AIR FORCE AND THE NAVY HAVE AGREED THAT THEY FACE A COMMON THREAT BUT USED DIFFERENT THREAT DENSITY INFORMATION WHEN DESIGNING THE ALR-74 AND THE ALR-67.

--

A PLAN FOR JOINT DEVELOPMENTAND ACHIEVING COMMONALITY HAS OF AGREEMENT FOR THE JOINT NOT BEEN PREPARED, A MEMORANDUM PROGRAMWAS COMPLETED IN LATE 1982 BUT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE SINCE THE JOINT PROGRAMNEVER FORMED.

ON A POSITIVE NOTE, DOD SUPPORTS THE NEW INTEGRATED ELECTRONIC WARFARE SYSTEM, CALLED INEWS, AND RECOMMENDS THAT THE AIR FORCE THE NAVY, AND ARMY USE IT ON THE NEXT GENERATION AIRCRAFT. IF THE

SERVICES COMPLY WITH DOD's RECOMMENDATION, INEWS HAS SOME HOPE FOR ACHIEVING SOME COMMONALITY.

OTHER MISSED OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMONALITY NEVERTHELESS, INEWS WILL NOT SOLVE THE PROLIFERATION PROBLEM IN EXISTING AIR FORCE AND NAVY RWR PROGRAMS. THE ABSENCE OF COMMONALITY INDICATED BY THE ALR-67 AND THE ALR-74 PROGRAMEVENTS TELLS ONLY A SMALL FART OF THE STORY.

WE FOUND THAT THE AIR FORCE AND THE NAVY ARE ACQUIRING NINE DIFFERENT RWRs FOR EXISTING TACTICAL AIRCRAFT AT A COST EXPECTED TO EXCEED $6.6 BILLION. AS INDICATED IN TABLE 1, NONE OF THE RWRs ARE

COMMONTO BOTH AIR FORCE AND NAVY AIRCRAFT.

WE ALSO FOUND THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE ALR-69 AND ALR-45F PROGRAMS, ALL OF THE RWRs HAVE ENTERED DEVELOPMENT OR PRODUCTION SINCE THE 1982 HEARINGS. TO CREATE AND PERPETUATE EACH RWR PROGRAM ON THE BENEFITS OF

REPRESENTS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO CAPITALIZE COMMONALITY.

FOR EXAMPLE, A MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO CURTAIL

PROLIFERATION WITHIN THE AIR FORCE OCCURREDIN 1982 WHEN THE F-15, F-16, AND F-111 AIRCRAFT WERE CONSIDERED TO NEED NEW RWRs.

AN EXCERPT FROM A LETTER TO THE AIR FORCE VICE CHIEF OF STAFF FROM THE COMMANDER OF WARNER ROBINS AIR LOGISTICS CENTER STATES THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTING NOW. ,, . . .REDucING THE R&D [RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT], As WELL As INITIAL PRODUCTION COSTS, IS A MUST IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE WE NEED

THE SUPPORT WOULD BE GREATLY REDUCED. INSTEAD OF SIX DIFFERENT SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT, WE WOULD ONLY REQUIRE TWO WHICH MEANS CONTINUOUS UPDATES TO TWO SOFTWAREPROGRAMSINSTEAD OF SIX. . ."

DESPITE THIS ENCOURAGEMENT,SEPARATE DEVELOPMENTSWERE ALLOWED TO PROCEED.

WHY IS COMMONALITY DIFFICULT

TO ACHIEVE?

THE MAIN PROBLEM IN ACHIEVING COMMONALITY SEEMS TO BE A PROCUREMENT PROCESS LED BY SERVICE PREFERENCES AND THE PERPETUAL UPDATING OF UNIQUE SYSTEMS. EACH SERVICE BELIEVES THAT ITS CONCEPT FOR A

SYSTEM IS BEST AND WILL OPPOSE COMPROMISE OF ITS DESIGN OR PERFORMANCEGOALS. ONCE AN RWR HAS BEEN DEVELOPED, THE ONLY

ALTERNATIVE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED WHEN IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED IS AN UPDATE OF THAT RWR OR A NEW SERVICE-UNIQUE SYSTEM.

THE SERVICE OFFICIALS'
SYSTEM

MAIN ARGUMENTAGAINST CHANGING TO A COMMON

WAS THE COST OF SO CALLED GROUP A CHANGES. THESE CHANGES

INVOLVE AIRCRAFT WIRING ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOMMODATE A REPLACEMENT RWR. WE RECOGNIZE THAT AIRCRAFT WIRING CHANGES CAN BE COSTLY. TO REJECT COMMONALITY BASED ON GROUP A COSTS WHILE IGNORING THE OFFSETTING COST BENEFITS OF COMMONALITY IS IMPROPER AND INCONSISTENT WITH DOD POLICY. BUT

11

DOD's POLICY REQUIRES AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF PROGRAMALTERNATIVES BEFORE RESOURCECOMMITMENTS. SUCH AN ANALYSIS, IN OUR OPINION,

SHOULD CONSIDER NOT ONLY THE COST OF GROUP A CHANGES, BUT ALSXp THE POTENTIAL SAVINGS THAT COULD RESULT FROM A PROGRAMALTERNATIVE ACHIEVING COMMONALITY. WE FOUND, HOWEVER, THAT THE SERVICE ANALYSES DONE IN JUSTIFYING THEIR RWR PROGRAMS DID NOT CONSIDER THE

COST BENEFITS OF COMMONALITY.

MR. CHAIRMAN, ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT THE MATTER IS THAT DOD HAS NOT EXERCISED ITS MANAGEMENTAUTHORITY TO OVERCOMETHE OBSTACLES TO COMMONALITY, BUT ACQUIESCED TO THE SERVICES' INSISTENCE ON SEPARATE PROGRAMS.

WE BELIEVE THAT A COMMON RWR IS FEASIBLE.

THE BASIC FUNCTION OF

THE NUMEROUSSERVICE RWRs IS THE SAME, AND EACH FACES A COMMON THREAT. A COMMONRWR COULD BE DEVELOPED WITH REQUIRED INTERFACES, SOME

AND COULD BE USED ON THE DIFFERENT TACTICAL AIRCRAFT. GOVERNMENT AND CONTRACTOROFFICIALS OPINION.

AS WITH THE NEED FOR COMMONALITY, THE CONGRESSHAS ALSO EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF ADEQUATE TESTING BEFORE DECISIONS ARE MADE TO PRODUCE DEFENSE SYSTEMS. TESTING IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT SYSTEMS WILL MEET COMBAT REQUIREMENTS. 12

PROVIDES FOR OPERATIONAL TESTING TO ENSURE THAT ONLY EFFECTIVE AND SUITABLE SYSTEMS ARE DELIVERED TO OUR FORCES.

WE FOUND WIDESPREAD CONCURRENCY IN THE AIR FORCE AND THE NAVY RWR PROGRAMS. REGRETTABLY, THIS ACQUIsITION STRATE'GY ALREADY HAS

RESULTED IN THE PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT THAT CANNOT BE USED FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE, PRODUCTION OF RWRs THAT WERE PLACED IN BONDED STORAGE RATHER THAN INSTALLED, AND FINALLY, JUDGED OPERATIONALLY UNSUITABLE To U.S. OFFICIALS. DEPLOYMENT OF RWRs

REVEALED THAT THE RWR WAS DEFICIENT,

THAT IT WILL MOST LIKELY BE USED AS "GENERIC" EQUIPMENT OR AS A SOURCE OF SPARE PARTS. ON RWR B, THE AIR FORCE STARTED PRODUCTIONBEFORE BEGINNING TESTING. SUBSEQUENTDEVELOPMENTAL TESTING SHOWEDTHAT THE RWR's

PERFORMANCE WAS WORSE THAN THAT OF THE RWR IT WAS INTENDED TO REPLACE.

THUS, THE AIR FORCE CONTINUED INSTALLING THE OLDER RWR IN PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT WHICH CAUSED A DRAWDOWN OF WARTIME RESERVES. MEANWHILE, THE AIR FORCE CONTINUED PRODUCTION OF RWR B ONLY TO PLACE IT IN BONDED STORAGE PENDING REDESIGN TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS.

THE AIR FORCE HAS RECENTLY DECIDED To BEGIN INSTALLING RWR B BECAUSE LIMITED TESTING HAS SHOWN ITS PERFORMANCE TO BE MARGINALLY BETTER THAN THAT OF THE RWR IT IS TO REPLACE. NEVERTHELESS, THE RELATED TEST REPORT STATED THAT RWR B Is STILL NOT CONSIDERED OPERATIONALLY SUITABLE.

THE NAVY STARTED PRODUCING RWR C WHILE TESTING WAS UNDERWAY. THE TESTING REVEALED SERIOUS DEFICIENCIES. THE TEST REPORT STATED,

HOWEVER, THAT RWR C WAS POTENTIALLY EFFECTIVE AND RECOMMENDED THAT THE RWR BE REDESIGNED TO CORRECT THE PROBLEMS. IT ALSO IN

RECOMMENDED THAT THE ADEQUACY OF THE CORRECTIONS BE VERIFIED ADDITIONAL TESTING. I MIGHT ADD AT THIS POINT, MR. CHAIRMAN,

THAT DOD's POLICY REQUIRES OPERATIONAL TESTING TO VERIFY THE EFFECTIVENESS AND SUITABILITY OF SYSTEMS FOR THEIR INTENDED USE.

NEVERTHELESS, THE NAVY CONTINUED PRODUCTION AND IN FEBRUARY 1987 CONTRACTED FOR THE LAST OF THE TOTAL PROGRAMQUANTITY OF RWR C.

I WOULD LIKE

TO POINT OUT THAT DESPITE THE EXPERIENCES

OF BOTH THE AIR FORCE AND NAVY, THE AIR FORCE CONTINUES TO FOLLOW THIS CONCEPT OF CONCURRENCY. AS INDICATED IN TABLE 2, THE AIR FORCE PLANS TO START PRODUCING RWR E BEFORE TESTING IS COMPLETED.

AS YOU WILL RECALL, MR. CHAIRMAN, WE FOUND CONCURRENCY PREVAILING IN AIR FORCE YAMMER PROGRAMSAND TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS

THE SERVICES SEEM READY TO DISCOUNT THE RISKS OF THE MANY ADVERSE CONSEQUENCESINHERENT IN SUCH AN APPROACA. BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF THE RWR PROGRAMS, ONE OUTCOMEOF THIS APPROACH HAS BEEN TO SPEED THE ACQUISITION OF DEFICIENT OR UNPROVEN SYSTEMS. FOR

EXAMPLE, HASTENING THE PRODUCTION OF A SYSTEM ONLY TO PUT IT IN STORAGE FENDING FIXES DOES NOT ENHANCE OUR COMBAT POSTURE.

RECOMMENDATIONS WE RECOMMEND THAT THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE (1) SELECT THE BEST

RWR, BASED ON COST AND EFFECTIVENESS, FOR MAXIMUM COMMONUSE ON EXISTING AIR FORCE AND NAVY TACTICAL AIRCRAFT AND (2) STOP THOSE
