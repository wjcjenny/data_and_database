August 4, 1986 The Honorable James A. McClure Chairman, Comnittee on Energy and Natural Resources United States Senate The Honorable Charles E. Bennett Chairman, Subcorsnittee on Seapower and Strategic and Critical Materials Committee on Armed Services House of Representatives 1985, you asked us to evaluate the National Security Council's study of national defense stockpile goals, the results of which ware announced on July 8, 1985, and to obtain participating agencies' views on the study. In subsequent discussions with your office, we were asked to provide this interim briefing report assessing whether the NSC stockpile study is a sufficient basis for U.S. mobilization planning, including the proposed changes in national defense stockpile goals.
(NSC's)

In July

Materials, such as cobalt and titanium, are stockpiled to meet increased defense demands expected at the beginning of a wartime mobilization. Which materials, and the amounts to be stockpiled, can vary significantly depending on the assumptions used. Assumptions need to be made about issues such as the anticipated defense demand, the capability of U.S. industry to surge to meet demand, sacrifices in consumer-goods production to reallocate resources to mobilization needs, and the availability of materials from foreign sources in times of conflict. Because of the assunptions it used, the NSC study recomnended a stockpile goal of $0.7 billion, which is much lower than the previous goal of $16.1 billion, established based on a 1979 study. Of $10.1 billion in stockpile inventory on hand against the previous $16.1 billion goal, the NSC study recomnended selling $3.2 billion and holding a $6 billion supplemental reserve, at least temporarily, of materials already on hand. Our preliminary assessment is that the NSC study does not appear to provide a sufficient basis for setting stockpile goals or for other U.S. mobilization planning. Although the NSC study methodology was similar to the methods of past studies and made some improvements, the assunptions used were very different, and the study report did not adequately reflect major disagreenents among study participants with regard to key assumptions. Furthermore, the study did not adequately show that its results could vary greatly with changes in its assunptions. Such ranges

We caution that this preliminary assesanent is based on a partial analysis of unclassified material. In our ongoing evaluation of the NSC stockpile study, we are reviewing the stockpile study report and supporting classified documentation, examining past stockpile studies and critiques of those studies, and discussing stockpile issues with representatives of each of the agencies that participated in the NSC m are also obtaining the views of outside experts. study. In our remaining work, one of the key steps is to determine which of NSC's assunptions have the most impact on the level of the stockpile. In order to accomplish this task, sensitivity tests need to be conducted for each assunption. MAJOR QUESTIONS ARISING IN OUR EVALUATION OF THE NSC STOCKPILE STUDY Although our work is not complete, it raises questions about whether the NSC study adequately supports its recommendations to (1) significantly reduce stockpile-goal levels and (2) use the study's planning assump tions for other mobilization-preparedness areas. Specific questions include whether NSC study assumptions are consistent with defense planning assunptions and data, with past U.S. economic experience and economic projections by other groups, and with estimates of supply and demand by industry and other experts. Study participants and industry and economic experts have expressed For serious concerns about study assunptions, methodology, and results. example, key study participants said that they did not agree with NSC's and that the NSC strrly did not adequately show the impact assumptions, Our initial tests confirmed this, and of alternative assumptions. showad that stockpile-goal levels can vary widely as assunptions change.

Hoever, NSC' s For example, study participants reported that adjustments were limited. no changes were considered for such factors as oil availability and Also, the reported adjustments for essential civilian requirements. such assunptions as defense-sector requirements covered only part of the assumptions' plausible ranges.

The impact of these kinds of assunption changes needs to be clearly identified through additional analyses .
BASIS E'OR INTERIM STOCKPILE PURCHASES OR DISPOSALS

While we believe that final congressional action on approving a stockpile goal should not be made until we have completed our evaluation, and the Administration has responded to our findings, there appear to be some low risk interim actions that can be taken based on areas where the NSC and 1979 studies are in agreement. Both the NSC study and a 1979 interagency study, coordinated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, agree that about $3.4 billion worth of materials on hand are excess to national security needs, and could be sold or bartered. On the other hand, the current inventory of at least one material--germanium--falls short of both its current and NSCE'urthermore, material experts among the study participroposed goals. pants and advisory comnittees say that some materials being stockpiled, such as cobalt, may need to be upgraded. Your Committees may wish to discuss with one or more of these organizations, such as the National Platerials Advisory Council or the General Services Administration, the desirability of using proceeds from future disposal sales, or moneys already in the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund, to upgrade such materials.
* * * * *

We discussed our preliminary results with NSC and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) officials who coordinated the NSC study. They told us that stockpile goals were driven primarily by defense planning assumptions, and that they believed the WC study's assumptions to be consistent with defense planning. A detailed discussion would involve classified information; howaver, we can point out that the defense guidance addresses a likely range of wartime effort including levels 3

B-223657

greater than assumed by NSC. Also, unlike the NSC study, which accepts increased reliance on foreign sources of material supply, the defense guidance indicates that a growing reliance on foreign sources poses a threat to national security. Analyses of different assumptions than those used in NSC's proposed $691 million stockpile goal would, in our opinion, show a much broader range of stockpile goal options. Differing assumptions for a variety of factors have been suggested by top study participants and other experts. In response to our request for further analyses of defense and other NSC and OMBofficials said that they would consider assumptions, analyzing key assumptions on a case-by-case basis, but they have not yet begun such analyses. Ws are sending copies of this briefing report to the Chairmen, Senate and House Comnittees on Armed Services, the Senate and House Coamittees on Appropriations, the Senate Ccm-mittee on Governmental Affairs, and the House Comnittee on Government Operations; to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs; and to the heads of the 12 agencies which participated in the NSC study. Copies will be made available to other interested parties upon request.

The Act be sufficient to cover U.S. a national emergency.

The President approves stockpile policy, which is to be followed in determining the stockpile goals. The goals are the difference between emergency supply and estimated 3-year requirements for each strategic material, such as cobalt and titanium. Since the passage of the Stockpiling and actual inventories have varied stockpile was initially expected years; later the time was reduced, year, and-- in 1976--was increased been relatively stable since the policy and goals which President dent Carter reaffirmed in 1977. in 1979 using then-existing policy improve methodology.

NSC does not clearly define the rationale for holding supplemental reserve commodities as part of the national defense stockpile. Also, $1.9 billion (almost one third of the entire proposed reserve) exceeds national defense requirements as computed by both the NSC study proposes to For example, the 1979 and NSC studies. retain $1.8 billion worth of tin in the supplemental reserve, although the study's computed requirement for tin was zero, and the current goal (based on the 1979 study) is only $0.5 billion.

EVALUATION OF METHODOLOGY AND ASSUMPTIONS USED TO SET STOCKPILE GOALS IN THE NSC STOCKPILE STUDY
NSC

METHODOLOGY

methodology followed the basic approach of prior The NSC study studies but used different assumptions and different models (for example, the Wharton econometric model to determine the Gross National Product ,GNP , rather than the Chase model). Key participating agencies included NSC; the Central Intelligence Agency; the Council of Economic Advisors; the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Interior, Defense (DOD), State, and Treasury; the Federal Emergency Management Agency; the General Services Administration; and OMB. The fundamental approach of the NSC study was to estimate material demand and supply for 3 years of war and compare the two. The study estimated material demand by (1) using macroeconomic models to estimate industry-output dollar levels for a wartime economy, and then (2) converting these industry-output levels into demands The study for critical materials expressed in physical units. estimated material supply by (1) estimating world production capacity of raw materials; and (2) subtracting some, but not all, and (3) reducing overseas materials demand from foreign countries; attrition during transporsupply for such reasons as war damage, tation, and reliability of foreign sources of supply. projected significantly reduced material demands The NSC study some increased supply relative to the prior study, and initially computed a stockpile goal of $230 million, using October 1984 prices. The goal was subsequently increased to $691 million, based on limited assumption changes and May 1985 prices. The limited changes increased material requirements for the defense and industrial sectors and reduced world supply.

The NSC study did not include adequate sensitivity analyses to show the impact of changes in major assumptions. Key assumptions questioned by study participants included minerals-production levels, materials-use for a given level of industrial output, and selection of reliable foreign sources. Stockpile goals are extremely sensitive to changes in such assumptions. Our review suggests that one of the most critical overall assumptions is the war scenario and associated wartime demand. Our tests of plausible upper limits of wartime demand showed potential goals to be far greater than the NSC's $0.7 billion, even if the other NSC assumptions remain unchanged. These upper limits were determined using input from study participants, and from industry and economic experts. Another assumption, dealing with the capability of the United States to increase material supply, has less impact on stockpile goals, but may have significant impact when combined with the impact of other assumptions.

NSC's economic assumptions include small increases in GNP, which have the effect of reducing stockpile goals. The following two figures show data for wartime growth rates in GNP and the defense share of GNP. Included for comparison with NSC's estimates are actual data from World War II and the Korean War (to show actual wartime experience), u,s. and estimated data from the 1979 study (to show one other projection).

These increases were less than those assumed by the 1979 study (33.3 and also less than those that actually occurred in the percent), Korean War (25.7 percent) and World War II (65.4 percent). If the higher GNP increases favored by some study participants are assumed, it results in greater levels of production and a greater need for stockpiled material.

To determine a plausible range of defense expenditures for sensitivity testing, we consulted with economic-modeling experts, and estimated defense expenditures using World War II experience with adjustments for changes since World War II. We found that, for sensitivity-testing purposes, the U.S. economy could operate with projected wartime defense expenditures 50 percent greater than the amount NSC used to compute stockpile goals, and that an upper limit could be about twice the amount NSC used. We requested data on sensitivity analyses done by study participants, and were advised that nothing was documented beyond the limited tests described in the NSC report. The NSC tests were Limited in that the tests for some assumptions covered only part of the possible ranges. Also, the tests simply adjusted output data for material supply and demand. The proper method of changing assumptions would have been to enter new defense expenditure data in the initial stages of the model-estimation process, and 17

allow the models to determine what material resulted. The method used did not measure effects, such as production bottlenecks.

We believe that additional sensitivity analyses are needed to better determine the impact of different assumptions favored by key study participants and outside experts. We are attempting to reach a mutually satisfactory arrangement with NSC to perform the additional analyses using the NSC model. In the meantime, we are proceeding with limited and simple analyses of our own. For example, the limited analyses described below address an expanded range for just two (defense-sector demand and programs to increase U.S. material supply) of numerous interrelated factors. We have been unable to do a full analysis because we do not have access to all of the models used in the NSC study. The data below is intended to show a need for accurate analyses of apparent wide swings in stockpile-goal levels, not to predict actual goals for a given set of assumptions. Effect of defense-sector material demand on stockpile goals

We found that different assumptions about defense-sector material demand within a plausible range (as suggested by our analyses and the opinions of study participants and outside experts) produced significant changes in stockpile goals. The significant changes occurred even though other NSC assumptions (such as those about U.S. production capacity and reliable foreign supply) were left unchanged. A 50-percent increase in defense-sector material Doubling demand more than quadrupled total stockpile-goal value. the defense sector material demand resulted in more than a tenfold increase. such as titanium, appeared partiSome materials, cularly sensitive to changes in defense-sector demand.

We recognize that specific estimates of the size of the Nonethedefense sector would likely fall below that upper limit.

The tiSC and OMB officials also commented that the highest goal resulting from this sensitivity test was still within the stockpile value recommended by the NSC study ($0.7-billion goal plus S6-billion supplemental reserve) and well below the current goal of $16.1 billion.

The goals for some materials, such as titanium, are particularly sensitive to assumption changes. In our test described above, the upper limit for titanium need was greater than NSC's proposed goal and supplemental reserve combined. Further analyses could show that other materials likewise exceed both NSC's proposed goal and supplemental reserve. The combined effect of several key factors could be significantly greater than the effect of one factor alone. This is indicated by our test of the assumptions regarding one aspect which is discussed below. of supply, of programs to increase U.S. material supply

Effect

To alleviate shortfalls in materials available from reliable sources worldwide, NSC explored ways to increase domestic availability of such materials through such programs as opening new mines or reopening closed mines. Such programs are intended to raise supply above the levels achievable through surging existing facilities. Such additional programs alone did not appear to have great impact on stockpile goals, but the effect became significant when considered in conjunction with defense-sector demand. For its base case, NSC assumed that such programs could increase supply for 29 different stockpiled commodities, generally during each year of a war. Some study participants and industry experts believed that such a large number of programs was not feasible simultaneously, saying that supply for perhaps only two or three materials could be successfully increased. The 1979 study assumed that no more than three materials could be increased through such programs, and those mainly in the third year of the scenario. Also, industry representatives told us that material supply would not be likely to increase as much or as quickly as NSC assumed. For example, copper industry representatives told us that the U.S. smelter industry may not be able to handle the domestic ore Opening new 'production increases that the NSC study projected. sme,lters could raise capacity, but industry estimates of the time req,uired to build a smelter ranged from 2 to 4 years. If it is assumed that als in the second and stockpile goal almost supply was increased third years of the doubles (from $230 for only three NSC's scenario, million to $445 materiinitial million).

However, when combined with increased defense-sector demand, the impact was substantially greater. With a 50-percent increase in defense-sector demand, the lower assumptions for material supplies raised the stockpile goal by about $.6 billion (from $1 billion for increased defense-sector demand alone to $1.6 billion). The reason for the increased impact is that, in many cases, a material's stockpile goal was zero, both with and without programs to increase supply. the factor had no impact by itself in Thus, those cases.

The Administration proposal stated that the NSC study assumptions "also will be used for other appropriate mobilization preparedness areas. " Although official documents do not clearly identify the NSC study participants stated that two potential specific areas, uses were in deciding on requests for protection of U.S. industries endangered by foreign competition,2 and on providing direct assistance to U.S. industries under the Defense Production Act of 1950. The use of the NSC study assumptions could affect the implementation of the above Acts. For example, under the NSC assumptions, a lower than previous level of wartime material needs for manufacturing resulted in less need for stockpiled materials. By the same assumptions, it could be argued that with less manufacturing need, U.S. industry would need less assistance or protection from foreign competition. Conversely, assumptions that would require more manufacturing and stockpiling could be used as the basis for more assistance to, or greater protection of, U.S. industry. Thus, our concerns about the effect of assumptions used to set also apply to the effect of the stockpile goals in the NSC study, as/sumptions on other mobilization preparedness areas. BASIS FOR INTERIM STOCKPILE PURCHASES OR DISPOSALS

The Administration's Fiscal Year 1987 Annual Materials Plan proposes purchasing 30,000 kilograms of germanium for $30 million, aqd selling 37 materials for $303 million. It also proposes selling 9 additional materials with no specified value. The plan notes that changes to existing legislation are required to implement it. Because of congressional concerns about the adequacy of the NSC study.as a basis for setting stockpile goals, decisions on identifying surplus materials for disposal could be further delayed. If some acquisitions and disposals were deemed necessary, however, alternatives may be available. For example, disposals could be considered from the about $3.4 billion worth of
