THE CIPREPORT
MAY 2003 / VOLUME 1, NUMBER 11
On January 24, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security became the 15th executive department of the President's Cabinet. In the biggest reorganization of the Federal government since World War II, Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge took over the leadership of 22 previously disparate agencies, bringing over 170,000 professionals into the umbrella of homeland security. The Department's first priority is to protect the nation against further terrorist attacks-a mission it will undertake by analyzing threats, guarding borders and airports, safeguarding critical infrastructure, and coordinating our national response to future emergencies. In its first 100 days, the Department has already made significant progress in a number of areas, including: Orchestrated and launched Operation Liberty Shield, the first comprehensive, national plan to increase protections of America's citizens and infrastructure; Deployed new technologies and tools at land, air and sea borders; Stood up the Homeland Security Command Center, a national 24-7 watch operation; Launched the Ready campaign, a national multimedia public infor-

Cyberspace and the Department of Homeland Security: Goals, Challenges, and What's to Come
Libutti's two deputies are Robert Liscouski and Paul Redmond. Liscouski is in charge of the "IP" component of IAIP. He comes from the private sector, where he was most recently the Director of Information Assurance for CocaCola. Redmond had an extended and diverse career in the Central Intelligence Agency. The mix within the Department will also be flavored by the agencies in its ambit that include cybersecurity research as part of their agendas. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert (R-NY) called a hearing of the Science Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives on May 14, 2003, to evaluate the status of cybersecurity work at the DHS. Boehlert and others in Congress have expressed concern that cybersecurity expenditure and research focus appears to be shrinking rather than increasing, despite growing budget figures for research and development in homeland security. McQueary's testimony at that hearing indicated that the DHS has begun to confer with the Infosec Research Council (IRC) - a loose affiliation of four other agencies - to help shape and inform its research agenda. The backgrounds of the IRC agency directors provide helpful context in understanding the personalities and politics involved in cybersecurity prioritization. The IRC's main members are the --8-- Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA, directed by Dr. Tony Tether), the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST, directed by Arden L. Bement), the National Science Foundation (NSF, directed by Dr. Rita Colwell), and the National Security Agency (NSA). All of these people - McQueary, Libutti, Liscouski, Tether, Bement, and Colwell - are gifted, capable leaders. But they are not cybersecurity professionals. Identifying Goals and Challenges To some extent, this experienced management team is not composed of cybersecurity professionals because leadership requires experience, and experience requires time. Achieving senior status in any of these organizations is almost antithetical to the field of cybersecurity: this is a relatively new field with rules that change almost monthly and experts that come and go rapidly. The field has not settled down enough to allow for long-term seniority. One goal, then, is this: to identify the personnel and proposals that have staying power, and then to incorporate both into the research agendas of the relevant agencies. Not least, those of us interested in the future of cybersecurity must identify which connections and which concepts may be able to bend the ear of leadership. (Continued, Page 14)

Figuring out what's coming down the pike involves no small amount of guesswork especially in a fast-changing arena like cybersecurity. But the Department of Homeland Security has started to assemble the team of people who will be working on prioritizing and funding these issues, so this is a good time to take a close look at where we are, and where we might be in a few months (or a few years). To summarize the descriptions that you may find in more complete form throughout this issue of The CIP Report, here's the lay of the land so far: The Science and Technology Directorate within the DHS is headed by Gen. Charles McQueary (Ret.). He is retired from the presidency of General Dynamics Advanced Technology Systems, and has a strong knowledge as well of the telecommunications industry, having served as vice president and president of business units within AT&T and Lucent. Within DHS, the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) section is likely to be most closely involved in setting cybersecurity policy. Frank Libutti is the recently appointed Under Secretary for IAIP. He comes to the DHS from New York City, where he directed counter-terrorism efforts. Prior to working in the counterterrorism field, he had a long and distinguished career in the Marines.

Homeland Security Volunteers Policy makers, state officials, and first responders are not the only ones working on homeland security. Thousands of normal citizens are getting involved through volunteer work to do their part in the war on terror. In July 2002 the Corporation for National and Community Service awarded $10.3 million in competitive grants, funded by Congress, to 43 non-profit and public organizations across 26 states and the District of Columbia. These groups will support more than 37,000 volunteers for local efforts to develop disaster response plans, expand Neighborhood Watch and Community Emergency Response Teams, establish Medical Reserve Corps, train youth to cope with disasters, disseminate information on bioterrorism, and assist ham radio operators and volunteer pilots in responding to disasters. mation on the National VOAD, visit www.nvoad.org).

into areas of need. Harnessing the resources offered by volunteers is absolutely critical, because a community's many needs during a disaster cannot be fully provided by governmental agencies and established disaster relief organizations. Emergent volunteers can be the "first real responders" for the first few critical hours and maybe even for days along with professional rescue teams and the military. Grants in Action The state of Tennessee's Commission on National and Community Service received one of the grants and awarded a portion of that grant to Volunteer Memphis, an organization that connects people with opportunities to serve those in greatest need. The goal of Volunteer Memphis' grant is to create and implement a disaster response plan which recruits and places emergent volunteers in appropriate tasks or organizations, provides information and assistance to area agencies in need of volunteers and coordinates recovery efforts with other voluntary disaster relief agencies. Shannon Dixon serves as the Disaster Preparedness Coordinator responsible for carrying out this goal.

THE HOMELAND SECURITY ACT OF 2002
by Robert Almosd, Second-Year Student, George Mason University School of Law
In the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush signed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, consolidating 22 Federal agencies into one Department. The new Department of Homeland Security is intended to protect the homeland from acts of terrorism. The organic act creating the new department was the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (H.R. 5005). Congressman Richard K. Armey introduced the bill on June 24, 2002 on behalf of 118 other Representatives cosponsoring the legislation. Because of the importance of the establishment of the new Department, Congress worked hard to pass the legislation quickly. The Act, on fast track, was adopted by both the House of Representatives and the Senate

in five months. The President signed the bill into law on November 25, 2002. The primary purpose of the Homeland Security Act is the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security. The Department is headed by the Secretary of Homeland Security who is appointed by the President. The Act sets up five DHS Directorates and establishes other critical agencies, or transfers entire existing agencies or agency functions into DHS. The Act also creates Under Secretaries to head the Directorates and other leadership positions to oversee the agencies. The Act describes the authorities and responsibilities of these officers.

HSA (Cont. from Page 10) Interaction with Nonfederal Entities Recognizing that information sharing is important not only horizontally within the Federal government, but also vertically between the Federal government and State & local agencies, the Act creates a process for DHS to interact with nonfederal entities. The SAFETY Act, which is integrated into Title VIII of the Homeland Security Act as Subtitle G, is a good example to demonstrate how the Homeland Security Act coordinates anti-terrorism related interaction between the Federal government and private entities. National Homeland Security Council An additional achievement of the Homeland Security Act is the creation of the National Homeland Security Council within the executive Office of the President. The primary function of the Council is to advise the President on homeland security matters. The Council consists of the President, the Vice President, and cabinet level officials such as the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Defense. The President may appoint other officials to the Council. ensure the security of information transferred from one component of the Agency to an internal or external organization, the Act establishes a procedure for sharing information.

THE INFORMATION SECURITY WORK FORCE: The New Millennium
(This is the final installment of a three part series) The International Need for IS Workers Some employers of IT workers are looking to workers from other countries to meet their skill needs. Whether or not to allow larger numbers of skilled foreign workers to enter a country in order to meet employers' demands for more IT and IS workers can be a contentious issue. Throughout the technologically emerging and industrialized nations the IT and IS industry requires more skilled foreign workers to help meet skill shortages. The inability to find workers has limited growth, or in some cases, curtailed growth in the IT and IS industry as well as other parts of the economy that need IS workers. This insatiable need helps drive international work force requirements to meet the needs of international markets. The IS industry needs to be able to attract the best and brightest workers from around the world, and by definition the skilled IS worker will gravitate to market demands, worldwide. The alternative is to move the work to other countries capable of sustaining IT growth and IS at the expense of other nations. Mid-C Career Technical Workers In the midst of a tight IS labor market worldwide, there are numerous anecdotes of middleage technical workers having difficulty finding IS jobs. Data from the U.S. National Science Foundation indicate, however, that the employment profile for computer and math scientists closely parallels that of the overall science and engineering work force. It is important to recognize that the IS industry is young and fast growing compared to many other industries and, thus, has a younger worker demographic profile which may contribute to the perception that it is not a hospitable environment for midcareer workers to change careers. The IS industry is populated by many younger workers. Approximately 75 percent are under the age of 45. Many managers in the IS industry are in their 20s and 30s, and may be uncomfortable hiring or managing older and more experienced workers. Many IT companies having the need for experienced IS workers have operating modes that require long and intense work hours, and mid-career workers, for example those with family obligations, may be assumed to be unwilling to work these long hours (although they may in fact be willing). Some employers may hold the perception that midcareer workers expect higher pay for doing the same work that younger workers do. There is a perception that mid-career workers may not be current with the latest skills, may not be as flexi--12-- ble in doing different kinds of work, and may be less innovative, compared to younger workers. Some employers may have concerns that mid-career workers will cost the company more in insurance premiums, due to age and higher likelihood of having covered family members. On the other hand, many mid-career workers have kept up with the latest skills (or could easily obtain them), are innovative, and are willing to work long hours for market pay rates. Many midcareer workers have a breadth of experience that could benefit many young IT companies. Some mid-career unemployed and underemployed engineers may find difficulty in obtaining employment because they expect higher wages or, while they may be highly skilled and experienced, they may not have the specific technical skills that employers want. On the other hand, it is likely that some mid-career engineers who have appropriate skills and are willing to work at market wages are overlooked because of the perception-not the reality-that older workers cannot do the job. This group must be identified and marketed for training, or retraining in information security. Temporary and Contract Employees In an uncertain IT business environment, faced with rapid tech(Continued, Page 13)

Work Force (Cont. from Page 12) nological change, many employers seek flexible means of staffing their projects. Employers use independent contractors or temporary workers employed by staffing companies as a mechanism to meet their need for IT and IS workers in this dynamic environment. In the case of contract workers, the workers are not considered to be employees and are responsible, in many cases, for paying their own payroll taxes and unemployment insurance. In the case of temporary workers, the staffing companies are responsible for their employees' wages and legally required payroll deductions, and may provide some benefits as well. Using either independent contractors or temporary workers has advantages for the employer. Employers can get the specific skills they need for a temporary project without hiring people that might need to be laid off later. Employers can also check out people on a trial basis before deciding whether or not to hire them. And companies do not have to pay (at least not directly) for expensive benefit packages. Contract or temporary work can also be advantageous to some IS employees. Independent IS contractors with skills in high demand can get paid at a higher rate than most employees, and some workers desire the greater flexibility and variety that can come from temporary or contract work. Temporary work may let IS employees gain invaluable IS work experience that may make them even more marketable in this highly competitive market. On the other hand, many IS employees who accept such arrangements may prefer to have permanent employment. Today, the IT and IS industry has been expanding its use of various types of temporary workers. The increasing use of temporary workers has implications for the training of IS workers. When a company uses temporary or contract workers, it is generally purchasing skills for immediate use, and has little or no motivation for investing in training for that worker. The incentive and responsibility for investing in training lies clearly with the individual worker, and, to some extent with the organization that manages this temporary worker. Rapid, Steady Long-t term Growth There can be no disagreement that the numbers of core IT and IS workers in the industrialized nations have grown rapidly and steadily during the past fifteen years. In the United States the numbers of core IT and IS workers are projected to grow dramatically between 1996 and 2006. The Office of Technology Policy's analysis of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' growth projections for this period shows that the number of core IS and IT workerscomputer scientists, computer engineers, systems analysts and computer programmers-will grow from 1.5 million in 1996 to 2.6 million in 2006, an increase of 1.1 million. In addition, another 244,000 workers will be needed --13--

MAY 2003 / VOLUME 1, NUMBER 11 to replace those exiting these professions. The insatiable appetite and worldwide competition for the skilled IT and IS worker is and will continue to outstrip the worlds' supply. The Supply of Core IS Workers What is the composition of the IS work force? What are the primary educational and training pipelines that bring people into the core IS occupations? What is the demographic profile of these occupations? Who is likely to pursue these career fields in the future? Where are the untapped labor pools from which to draw IS workers? What are the educational and training pathways for people seeking to become IS workers? How do we better prepare students moving through various educational pipelines to engage in IS education and training for careers in industry and government? How do we improve existing pathways to better prepare students for an IS career? Where do we find the "right" people to train and to educate? How do we identify and "entice" people who have some or all or the requisite skills to consider retooling of a career in IS? How do we engage older members of the work force in bringing them into the IS work force? How do governments collaboratively engage in developing the new millennium IS worker without jeopardizing their national interests? How can academic institutions and corporate training programs work in a symbiotic fashion, both nationally and internationally, to leverage IS education and training for the IS work force? How do we prepare for tomorrow when we can barely prepare for today?

Insights (Cont. from Page 8) While other agencies and experts certainly offer valuable connections and concepts, DARPA explicitly addressed cybersecurity at the May 14 hearing. Dr. Tony Tether addressed Rep. Boehlert's concern about dwindling investment by noting that, increasingly, cybersecurity-related projects are cloaked in classified garb. Once classified, they are handled through a different budget process; they do not show up as identifiable line items in the same way that unclassified projects do. Dr. Tether's explanation makes it clear that we have a challenge to address here: as more and more projects move into the classified realm, how can the research agencies that are diligently working on cybersecurity challenges assure Congress and the public that progress is being made? DARPA, as well as the NSA, is focused on defense needs and defense networks. Classifying projects is standard in much of the defense world. This fact highlights another challenge for Critical Infrastructure Protection: protecting defense networks does not protect the 80-90 percent of CIP that resides in the private sector. What can happen - and is most useful - is that technologies developed first for defense use may be de-classified and commercialized for broad deployment. Firewalls, for instance, originated in the DARPA environment. The NSA has placed a pronounced value on technology transfer to the private sector, as

well. These initiatives are essential to disseminating a higher standard of security across the affected networks. Dr. Tony Tether testified on May 14 that DARPA continues to be acutely aware of cybersecurity needs and includes them under one of its eight strategic thrusts: "Robust, Self-Forming Networks." A related thrust is "Cognitive Computing," which can have an impact on cybersecurity in the long run if computers develop the ability to understand what is happening to them and to operate around detected limitations. Moving these bodies of knowledge into the private sector would help private network operators incorporate a layer of reassurance that is desperately needed. NIST, also, has been a natural leader in cybersecurity research. Its Computer Security Resource Center has focused on, and made significant strides in, several areas of research seen as key by a broad consensus of knowledgeable experts; it has a well-regarded and productive computer security division. It will probably continue in this capacity. Its Advisory Board has brought both fresh ideas and experienced views to NIST's leadership. Hopefully, DHS will come to a close relationship with the valuable distillation process that NIST has put in place. What's Next? As these players continue their work, the plot has thickened: following the departure of Richard Clarke and Howard Schmidt from the White House, cybersecurity as a named interest has suffered from --14--

MAY 2003 / VOLUME 1, NUMBER 11 the absence of a focal point. On May 27, 2003, The Washington Post announced that the White House plans to create a new position dedicated to cybersecurity within the DHS, as "an effort to appease frustrated technology executives over what they consider a lack of White House attention to hackers, cyberterror and other Internet threats." This is an important, although not unexpected, development. At press time for The CIP Report, no candidates had been named. The cybersecurity official is likely to influence policy direction for the rest of the Bush Administration, and - because the DHS itself is so new - may well leave an imprint well into another Administration, regardless of whether it is Republican or Democrat. The big questions looming over cybersecurity's next steps are: How high a priority? What standards? And who pays? These questions dominate almost all CIP discussions, but they are especially complex in the cyber arena. So far, government has resisted imposing burdensome and expensive regulation on cyber operations. Defining a style that enhances the effectiveness of the private sector's own activities, while refraining from imposing a heavy-handed and inefficient regulatory regime, is a delicate task. A list of ingredients does not a recipe make, but it's a good start. Name this key ingredient and we'll be able to figure out what we're cooking.
1In this context, it is only fair to note that the CIP Project benefits from NIST's funding foresight.

Federal Workforce Improvement The Homeland Security Act creates agency Chief Human Capital Officers and the Chief Human Capital Officers Council to improve the quality of the Federal workforce. These entities are charged with the improvement of agency human resources activities and development of a workforce improvement strategy based on the assessment of the future needs of agencies. Air Transportation Security Three provisions of the Act focus on the improvement of air transportation security. First, the Airline War Risk Insurance Legislation amends Section 44302 of title 49 of the US Code extending the termination of certain insurance policies issued by the Department of Transportation to air carriers. Second, the Arming Pilots Against Terrorism Act requires that the Undersecretary for Transportation Security establish a program to train volunteering pilots to become armed Federal flight deck officers to protect passengers and crew in cases of terrorist incidents. Finally, the Act provides for corrections to existing

Other Provisions Other provisions of the Act provide for technical amendments of existing law relating to, for example, the US Secret Service, the US Coast Guard, development of smallpox vaccine stockpile, transferring of certain law enforcement functions, transportation security regulations, biological weapons defense, and railroad and hazmat safety.

Department of Homeland Security Funding for States and Cities
Since Congress passed the FY '03 Budget in February and the FY '03 Supplemental Budget in April, the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness has made a significant amount of money available to states and cities to prevent, prepare and respond to terrorism. Nearly $4 billion has been made available to state and local governments to help first responders and offset costs associated with extra security measures. Grants for States, Cities, Urban Areas and First Responders March 7, 2003 - $566 million was made available to the states and cities from the FY '03 budget to assist first responders in the form of funding for equipment, training, planning and exercises. March 10, 2003 - $750 million was made available for firefighter assistance grants from the FY '03 Budget to help rural, urban and suburban fire departments better train, prepare and equip themselves. April 8, 2003 - $100 million was made available to certain cities as part of the urban area security initiative from the FY '03 Budget to help enhance the local government's ability to secure large population areas and critical infrastructure. April 16, 2003 - $165 million was made available from the FY '03 budget to help state and local governments better prepare for all hazards preparedness activities and emergency management. April 30, 2003 - $1.5 billion was made available to the states and localities from the FY '03 --15-- Supplemental Budget to help state and local law enforcement personnel pay for equipment, planning, training and exercises and to offset costs associated with enhanced security measures deployed during heightened threat periods. May 14, 2003 - $700 million was made available from the FY '03 Supplemental Budget as part of the urban area security initiative for 30 cities and their contiguous counties and mutual aid partners to enhance the security of urban areas with high density populations and critical infrastructure, ports and mass transit systems.

CIP PROJECT TO SPONSOR PUBLIC-P PRIVATE SECTOR DIALOGUE
The CIP Project is pleased to announce that we are furthering the national agenda of homeland security by leading a high-level discussion this June in Washington. Members of Congress and representatives from DHS and the private sector will participate in a CIP Project-sponsored discussion of priorities, cost, accountability and the roles of government and industry in homeland security. Panelists will include: * * * * * * * The Honorable Robert Liscouski, Assistant Secretary for Infrastruture Protection, Department of Homeland Security The Honorable Christopher Cox (R-CA), Chairman, House Select Committee on Homeland Security The Honorable Jane Harman (D-CA), Ranking Member, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence The Honorable John Hager, Assistant to the Governor for Commonwealth Preparedness (Virginia) Mr. John Derrick, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pepco Holdings, Inc. Ms. Catherine A. Allen, Chief Executive Officer, BITS, The Technology Group for The Financial Services Roundatable Moderator: Frank Sesno, University Professor of Public Policy and Communication; Senior Fellow, Critical Infrastructure Protection Project

Watch our website, http://techcenter.gmu.edu/programs/cipp.html, in late June for a transcript of this discussion.

The CIP Project is part of the National Center for Technology and Law at the George Mason University School of Law. It is a joint initiative between GMU and JMU that examines law, technology, and policy to find comprehensive solutions to the most pressing CIP issues for policy makers and critical infrastructure owners and operators. The CIP Project was launched in May 2002. The CIP Project encourages participation by representatives from all levels of government, academia, and private industry. The CIP Report is published by LegalNet Works, Inc. on behalf of the CIP Project. Formed in 1996, LegalNet Works Incorporated focuses on the development of information security laws and regulations with an emphasis on liability, risk management, national security, regulatory compliance, and privacy. LegalNet consults both government and industry officials on legal and policy reform in these complex areas.
