MR. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE:

I AM PLEASED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE TODAY TO TESTIFY ON OUR REVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE'S (DOD'S) FOR REVIEW

EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE A 'GREATER DEGREE OF INTEROPERABILITY COMMAND, CONTROL, AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS. YOU ASKED US TO PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO

MAXIMUM EFFECTIVENESS.

COMBINED USE IS ACCOMPLISHED USING THE VARIOUS

THROUGH THE CONTINUOUS EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION

ELEMENTS OF THE COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEMS WHICH SUPPORT AND LINK THE TACTICAL COMMANDER WITH OTHER COMMANDS AND ELEMENTS. ON THIS VITAL FLOW

EVERY ASPECT OF THE OPERATION DEPENDS HEAVILY OF INFORMATION.

INTEROPERABILITY--A

LONGSTANDING PROBLEM

HISTORICALLY

HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE OPERATIONS AND REPUBLIC

AMONG THEMSELVES DURING JOINT THIS

VIETNAM

AND, ALMOST 20 YEARS LATER, TODAY THERE ARE STILL

DURING THE GRENADA INSTANCES IN WHICH

INTERVENTION THE SERVICES

IN 1983.

CANNOT EFFECTIVELY

TALK OR EXCHANGE INFORMATION.

THE INABILITY

OF AIR AND GROUND UNITS

TO EFFECTIVELY FOR EXAMPLE, OR U.S.

COMMUNICATE CAN LEAD TO SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. SURFACE-TO-AIR AIRCRAFT -GRENADA. MISSILES COULD SHOOT U.S.

AIRCRAFT

COULD BOMB OR FIRE

UPON AMERICAN FORCES, AS OCCURRED IN

DURING THE VIETNAM WAR, THE SCARCITY

OF INTEROPERABLE ESPECIALLY

WHEN CLOSE AIR

GREATLY ENHANCE OPERATIONS. DIRECTOR OF DOD'S TACTICAL DELIVERED

ACCORDING TO A FORMER DEPUTY WARFARE PROGRAM, CLOSE AIR SUPPORT IS

AS NEEDED, QUICKLY,

AND IN THE RIGHT AMOUNT AND KIND IN

THE PRINCIPLE VIETNAM, AIR

MEANS OF REDUCING LOSSES ON THE .GROUND.

THE AIR

FORCE COULD NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE AND RESPONSIVE RADIOS WERE NOT

SUPPORT TO ARMY GROUND FORCES BECAUSE THEIR THE AIR

COMPATIBLE. VHF/FM RADIOS.

FORCE USED UHF/AM RADIOS WHILE THE ARMY USED

IN GRENADA, AIR

SUPPORT OPERATIONS WERE AGAIN

HAMPERED. TO

ARMY GROUND FORCES AND THE MARINES COULD NOT TALK DIRECTLY EACH OTHER BECAUSE EACH SERVICE HAD INCOMPATIBLE RADIOS.

FURTHERMORE, ARMY GROUND FORCES COULD NOT TALK TO NAVY SHIPS BECAUSE THE SERVICES HAD DIFFERENT PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING AIR AIR-AND FIRE

SUPPORT AND ARMY UNITS

COULD NOT AUTHENTICATE

SUPPORT REQUESTS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE NAVY CODES.

THE ABSENCE OF SECURE COMMUNICATIONS IN VIETNAM IMPAIRED OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A 1972

SEVERELY

HOUSE ARMED SERVICES FOUND

IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING VIETNAM, SIGNIFICANT

EACH SERVICE

HOWEVER, DURING GRENADA, THE SERVICES

WERE UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER IN A SECURE MANNER BECAUSE EACH SERVICE ARRIVED DIFFERENT DEVICES, RADIOS, SATELLITE IN GRENADA WITH A VARIETY OF

COMMUNICATIONS AND ENCRYPTION

ALL OF WHICH WERE INCOMPATIBLE.

IMPEDIMENTS

TO ACHIEVING

INTEROPERABILITY

A NUMBER OF REASONS HAVE BEEN CITED INTEROPEitABILITY PROBLEMS.

FOR CONTRIBUTING

TO BY

THREE REASONS FREQUENTLY CITED INCLUDE DOD'S

PAST STUDIES AND BY AGENCY OFFICIALS MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE,

DECENTRALIZED REQUIREMENTS,

LACK OF CLEARLY DEFINED JOINT

AND THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE

CENTRAL ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY.

9

MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE

AS IN A NUMBER OF PRIOR STUDIES, INTEROPERABILITY INTEROPERABILITY REPORTED IN 1985 IS PRIMARILY

A NAVY ADVISORY INABILITY

PANEL ON C3 TO ACHIEVE

THAT DOD'S

RELATED TO ITS

DECENTRALIZED

MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE WHICH PERMITS EACH SERVICE A LARGE DEGREE OF AUTONOMY OVER ITS PROGRAMS. ACCORDING TO THE PANEL, IS DIFFUSE, PERMITTING THE THE PAROCHIAL

ASSIGNMENT OF RESPONSIBILITIES SERVICES TO "REINTERPRET" INTERESTS BY DELAYING

ORDERS TO FURTHER SERVICE

OR PREVENTING INTERSERVICE

AGREEMENTS.

THE FIELDING THEATER ILLUSTRATES INTEROPERABILITY *JAM RESISTANT, COMMUNICATIONS.

OF THE REGENCY NET SYSTEM IN THE PACIFIC HOW PAROCHIAL INTEREST CAN IMPEDE

GOALS.

REGENCY NET IS

INTENDED TO BE A SECURE, THEATER

HIGH FREQUENCY RADIO SYSTEM FOR CRITICAL ALTHOUGH BOTH JCS AND THE OFFICE OF THE

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE (OSD) VALIDATED OVERCOME EXISTING OPERATIONAL

THE NEED FOR THE SYSTEM TO THE NAVY, RATHER THAN

DEFICIENCIES,

USE THE REGENCY NET RADIO FOR ITS FORCES AFLOAT, AND USE ITS OWN HIGH FREQUENCY RADIO.

WANTS TO DEVELOP HIGH

ALTHOUGH THE NAVY'S

FREQUENCY RADIO IS USING IT IN LIEU

PLANNED TO BE INTEROPERABLE WITH REGENCY NET,

OF THE APPROVED SYSTEM COULD MEAN A DELAY OF

ABOUT 5 YEARS BEFORE THE SYSTEM IS FULLY OPERATIONAL.

REQUIREMENTS

IN A STUDY OF TACTICAL 1983, THE INSTITUTE

COMMUNICATIONS COMPLETED IN MARCH (IDA) CONCLUDED THAT A

FOR DEFENSE ANALYSIS

"MAJOR PROBLEM IS A LACK OF ADEQUATE JOINT REQUIREMENTS . . ."

USER NEEDS AND

THE NAVAL ADVISORY NEITHER THE ASSISTANT MINIMUM

PANEL,

IN A 1985

STUDY,

FOUND THAT

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR C3 NOR THE JCS HAS ESSENTIAL INTEROPERABILITY REQUIREMENTS. THE

ESTABLISHED

LACK OF THESE REQUIREMENTS ALLOWS EACH SERVICE TO DETERMINE ITS OWN REQUIREMENTS, INTERSERVICE OFTEN WITH LITTLE, IF ANY, CONCERN FOR WHICH

NEEDS.

CONSEQUENTLY, MANY SYSTEMS ARE FIELDED

ARE NOT INTEROPERABLE.

JOINT

REQUIREMENTS WERE NOT AGREED TO WHEN THE AIR TACTICAL INFORMATION

FORCE AND

NAVY BEGAN TO DEVELOP THE JOINT SYSTEM (JTIDS). AS A RESULT,

DISTRIBUTION

THE TWO SERVICES,

WHEN DEVELOPING

THE SYSTEM, ADOPTED DIFFERENT INTEROPERABLE. DIFFERENT IN

TECHNOLOGIES THAT WERE NOT "THE USE OF TWO INCREASED COSTS AND FINALLY, IN

1982 WE REPORTED THAT,

TECHNOLOGIES WITH THE ASSOCIATED

INTEROPERABILITY 1985

PROBLEMS MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE."

THE CONGRESS TOLD DOD THAT IT WOULD FUND ONE PROGRAM ONLY OF THE TWO SERVICES TO

BECAUSE IT WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE ABILITY INTEROPERATE.

THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY SUBSEQUENTLY CANCELLED !4ILLION.

THE PROGRAM ON WHICH THE NAVY HAD SPENT OVER $100 11

A NUMBER OF STUDIES IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH ESTABLISH IT

HAVE CONCLUDED THAT IT

IS

CTOT ONLY

-JOINT REQUIREMENTS BUT THERE IS A NEED TO CYCLE. THIS IS BECAUSE

THEM EARLY IN THE ACQUISITION

IS USUALLY TOO DIFFICULT

AND COSTLY TO MODIFY SYSTEMS ONCE

THEY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND FIELDED.

DOD ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY FOR INTEROPERABILITY A COMMON THEME IN A NUMBER OF PAST STUDIES ORGANIZATION HAS OR IS WILLING TO EXERCISE ITS WAS THAT NO DOD AUTHORITY FOR EXISTING TO

ENFORCE INTEROPERABILITY SYSTEMS. THESE STUDIES

STANDARDS ESPECIALLY

HAVE SUGGESTED THAT CLEARER MECHANISMS SERVICE DEMANDS.

ARE NEEDED TO RESOLVE CONFLICTING

ONE EXAMPLE THAT ILLUSTRATES ATTEMPT To REVISE ITS BASIC

THIS

POINT PERTAINS (DOD DIRECTIVE

TO DOD'S 4630.5)

DIRECTIVE

DEALING WITH INTEROPERABILITY.

THE ASSISTANT

SECRETARY OF AND INTELLIGENCE

DEFENSE FOR COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, TESTIFIED

BEFORE THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE IN MARCH HE ENCOUNTERED AS FOLLOWS.

1985 ON THE DIFFICULTIES

tl . . . STARTING AGAIN

IN THE SEVENTIES

AND AGAIN

IN 1980

AND

IN 1983 WE TRIED

TO GET A NEW DIRECTIVE

THROUGH

THE PENTAGON BUREAUCRACY . . . FRANKLY,

WE HAVE NOT

BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN DOING THAT BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON WHAT SHOULD BE SAID 12 IN SUCH A DOCUMENT."

PACIFIC OF A SINGLE

COMMAND C3 OFFICIALS ENTITY

RECENTLY TOLD US THAT

THE LACK

IN DOD WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY

AND AUTHORITY

TO SET AND ENFORCE INTEROPERABILITY INTEROPERABILITY

STANDARDS IS ONE REASON FOR

PROBLEMS IN THEATER.

THE INSTITUTE CONCLUDED THAT

FOR DEFENSE ANALYSIS,

IN ITS

1983

STUDY,

"SECURE,

JAM RESISTANT

NET RADIOS AND DATA DISTRIBUTION

SYSTEMS . . . ENCOMPASS SUCH DIVERSE REQUIREMENTS AND APPROACHES AMONG THE THREE SERVICES THAT DUPLICATION LACK OF INTEROPERABILITY ARE ALMOST INEVITABLE AND

UNLESS SOME

CENTRAL CONTROL AUTHORITY CAN OVERSEE THE DEVELOPMENTS TAKING PLACE IN THE INDIVIDUAL SERVICES."

IN OUR 1983

REPORT ON JOINT

SYSTEM ACQUISITIONS,

WE REPORTED WORD OR OF ITS MILITARY THIS

THAT NO ORGANIZATION

OR MANAGEMENT LEVEL HAS THE FINAL

THE SUSTAINED CLOUT TO GAIN ACCEPTANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS. STAFF. THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE HAS NO SUBSTANTIAL OF THE JOINT CHIEFS

THE OFFICE

OF STAFF COULD FILL

VACUUM, BUT AS MANY OBSERVERS HAVE POINTED OUT, THE JCS IS NOT SET UP OR SO DETACHED FROM THE SERVICES AS TO BE ABLE TO RESOLVE SUCH CONFLICTS, OR TO CHOOSE THE SYSTEM OF ONE SERVICE OVER THE

SYSTEM OF ANOTHER.

ALTHOUGH BOTH THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND TO MAKE SUCH CHOICES, NEITHER HAS

THE JCS HAVE THE AUTHORITY

EXERCISED IT TO ANY GREAT DEGREE. 13

THE JOINT

TACTICAL

COMMAND,

CONTROL, AND COMMUNICATIONS AGENCY

OVER THE YEARS, INTEROPERABILITY

DOD HAS TAKEN STEPS TO IMPROVE THESE EFFORTS WERE PARTIAL THE

AMONG THE SERVICES.

STEPS AIMED AT SELECTED EQUIPMENT AND STANDARD FORMATS. JOINT TACTICAL

COMMAND, CONTROL, AND COMMUNICATIONS AGENCY, WHICH IN 1984, WAS GIVEN MUCH BROADER RESPONSIBILITIES. FOR FINDING AND PREVENTING ARENA. PROBLEMS IN SIMPLY PUT,

WAS ESTABLISHED

THE AGENCY IS RESPONSIBLE THE 'JOINT

AND COMBINED C3 INTEROPERABILITY

THE AGENCY WAS ESTABLISHED DOD, TO ADDRESS 'JOINT INTEROPE-ILITY INTEROPERABILITY.

STANDARDS, AND TO ACT AS THE "HONEST BROKER" FOR

MORE SPECIFICALLY, WHICH ESTABLISHED INTEROPERABILITY MAINTAINING

A JULY

5,

1984 DOD DIRECTIVE

5154.28,

THE AGENCY, CHARGED IT WITH ENSURING OF TACTICAL C3 SYSTEMS BY DEVELOPING AND AND

THE REQUIRED C3 ARCHITECTURE AND SPECIFICATIONS, TESTING AND AND AND

BY DEVELOPING AND CONDUCTING AN INTEROPERABILITY CERTIFICATION

PROGRAM TO ENSURE PROPER IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS FOR USE IN JOINT

MAINTENANCE OF APPROPRIATE COMBINED OPERATIONS.

14

FURTHERMORE, THE REVISED

1985

DOD DIRECTIVE

ALSO

CHARGED THE AGENCY TO REVIEW FOR INTEROPERABILITY ALL APPROVED SERVICE AND TO VERIFY ESTABLISHED AND UNIFIED

IMPLICATIONS,

THAT THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH

PLANS.

THE AGENCY VIEWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TACTICAL ARCHITECTURE AS ONE OF ITS AGENCY HAS DEFINED PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES.

THE DIRECTOR BELIEVES

COULD TAKE YEARS TO COMPLETE.

THE AGENCY'S AUTHORITY

THE AGENCY'S AN ADVISORY ONE.

ROLE IN ASSURING INTEROPERABILITY THE AGENCY DOES NOT HAVE AUTHORITY

IS PRIMARILY TO ALTER A MAY

PROGRAM REGARDLESS OF THE INTEROPERABILITY IDENTIFY. WHEN THE AGENCY IDENTIFIES

PROBLEM IT

AN INTEROPERABILITY BY CONSULTING WITH THE APPROACH FAILS, THE

PROBLEM, THE DIRECTOR TRIES AFFECTED SERVICE OR UNIFIED

TO RESOLVE IT COMMAND.

IF THIS

DIRECTOR REPORTS THE PROBLEM TO JCS AND/OR OSD, ALONG WITH HIS RECOMMENDATION. OSD RETAINS THE AUTHORITY TO APPROVE OR

DISAPPROVE SERVICE OTHER APPROPRIATE

PROGRAMS, AND IT MAY SUSPEND A PROGRAM OR TAKE ACTION IF THERE ARE UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS

WARRANTING SUCH ACTION.

15

SINCE ITS

FORMATION,

THE AGENCY HAS ISSUED

30 REPORTS

AREAS SUCH AS THE PROCEDURAL AND TECHNICAL COMMANDS

STANDARDS, AND THE ASSISTANCE ON INTEROPERABILITY TESTING, ISSUES,

PROVIDES TO THE UNIFIED

CONFIGURATION DATA BASES.

MANAGEMENT, JOINT

AND INTEROPERABILITY

ALTHOUGH THE MERE EXISTENCE CANNOT GUARANTEE INTEROPERABILITY, SOME INTEROPERABILITY

OF A JOINT IT

TACTICAL

C3 AGENCY

SHOULD HELP TO ALLEVIATE THE

PROBLEMS IN THE SHORT TERM AND RAISE

AWARENESS OF DOD COMPONENTS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING INTEROPERABILITY EARLY EFFORTS, IN THEIR C3 DECISIONS. SOME OF THE AGENCY'S COMMANDS COULD

SUCH AS ITS ASSESSMENT OF A UNIFIED

OPERATIONS PLAN AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS, IMPROVE INTEROPERABILITY. WHAT EXTENT THE AGENCY WILL OBJECTIVES. IT IS TOO EARLY,

HOWEVER TO TELL TO ITS

BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING

SUMMARY

IN SUMMARY, THE SERVICES HAVE HAD PROBLEMS EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATING IN JOINT CANNOT EFFECTIVELY EASY TASK. IT OPERATIONS AND IN SOME INSTANCES SOLVING THIS THEY

COMMUNICATE TODAY.

PROBLEM IS NO

REQUIRES THAT JOINT

REQUIREMENTS BE CLEARLY STATED IT WILL REQUIRE A

AND ACCEPTED BY THE SERVICES AT THE OUTSET.

GREAT DEAL OF COOPERATION AMONG THE SERVICES AND A GENUINE 16

WILLINGNESS

ON THE PART OF EACH SERVICE TO ACCEPT EVEN WHEN IT CONFLICTS IN ADDITION, THAT WILL WITH SOME TRADITIONAL NEEDS A STRONG

INTEROPERABILITY SERVICE PRACTICES. CENTRAL AUTHORITY DECISIONS

INTEROPERABILITY

BE WILLING

TO MAKE THE VERY DIFFICULT

THAT MUST BE MADE.

MR. CHAIRMAN,

THIS

CONCLUDES MY PREPARED STATEMENT.
