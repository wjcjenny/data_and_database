The Army's ammunition production base includes 28 government-owned ammunition plants as well as government-owned in numerous private sector plants located production equipment Seventeen of the 28 ammunition plants throughout the country. and the remaining 11 would only be used during are in operation, mobilization.

Numerous studies have documented problems with the For example, our February 1, 1983, ammunition production base. Observations Regarding the Ammunition Production Base report, pointed out that the production base had a (GAO/PLRD-83-381, tremendous capability and could generally produce the planned peacetime requirements for ammunition but that it lacked the capacity to produce a large part of the projected mobilization ammunition items. requirements for many new, more sophisticated We also reported that (1) some facilities could not be fully because of significant imbalances in used, if needed in wartime, capacities for producing various components required for end-item assembly and (2) many inactive production lines could not be reactivated as quickly as desired for mobilization because of equipment shortages and other deficiencies. In 1983 the House Committee on Armed Services directed the Secretary of the Army to review ammunition production facilities to (1) determine the condition of production equipment, (2) evaluate the capacity to produce ammunition quantities required the cost of by the Five Year Defense Plan, and (3) estimate modernizing and expanding facilities that would be needed to produce ammunition to meet peacetime and mobilization production On February 27, 1984, the requirements through fiscal year 2000. which concluded that much of the Army completed its study, that it lacked the capacity ammunition production base was old, to sustain mobilization demands, and that deficiencies in production equipment at inactive production facilities would affect the ability to respond to a national emergency. The study estimated it would cost about $3.6 billion over the next 15 years to modernize and expand ammunition production facilities to support peacetime procurements, $55.1 billion to modernize and expand ammunition production facilities to support and $43.9 billion to procure mobilization requirements, ammunition for stockpiling as war reserve inventories for use during mobilization until the production base could meet the The study stressed the projected mobilization consumption rates.

ARMY ACTIONS TO ADDRESS AMMUNITION PRODUCTION BASE PROBLEMS In forwarding the February 1984 study to the House Committee the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Research, on Armed Services, Development and Acquisition) stated that a 5-year defense to begin in fiscal year 1987, would be developed. He program, said that the program would include initiatives to reduce mobilization deficiencies but that funding the initiatives would depend on priorities and availability of resources to the Army The proposed program was developed and the ammunition program. Army Armament, Munitions, and Chemical Command by the U.S. but it was not intended as a budgetary (AMCCOM) in April 1985, the Army was not ready to request additional request. Also, funding to address mobilization production base deficiencies. called the Initiative to Reduce Ammunition AMCCOM's program, identified actions that could be taken Mobilization Deficiencies, during the first 5 years of a 15-year program to improve the AMCCOM assumed preparedness of the ammunition production base. that the 5-year period was for fiscal years 1987 to 1991 and that $500 million in addition to the funding needed for the annual peacetime procurement programs would be available each year to reduce mobilization deficiencies. 4

During the first 5-year increment, AMCCOM planned to (1) (2) eliminate reduce startup times at ammunition plants, deficiencies at two propellant and explosive plants, (3) expand the production capacity for an explosive called RDX, and (4) expand the production capacity for ammunition end items to about 40 percent of the estimated monthly mobilization requirements. The first year of the program called for $103.4 million for engineering and design. According to Army representatives, the Army is updating the 1985 AMCCOM program by using improved cost estimates and updated mobilization requirements. The updated program will also include greater involvement by private industry in production during mobilization. The study will cover fiscal years 1988 through 1997 and will be used as a basis for requesting funds in the However, Army future budgets for the ammunition production base. representatives said that it is unlikely that any funding request for designs or facilities to correct mobilization production base deficiencies would be approved by Army Headquarters because of other higher priority deficiencies.

Except for some funds for explosives called RDX and HMX, the Army's fiscal year 1986 budget request did not include projects to reduce mobilization deficiencies. The Senate Committee on Appropriations asked the Army to identify mobilization projects that could be implemented during fiscal year 1986 on a fixedThe Army identified nine projects price contract basis. estimated to cost $103.1 million and the Congress provided the Army representatives told us that the projects they funding. identified did not represent the best use of the $103.1 million. They said that those projects with the highest priority (i.e., projects to reduce mobilization deficiencies for critical components and high priority end items) had not been designed. Funding for design work is largely limited to designing those ammunition production base projects needed to establish the peacetime production base required to produce ammunition components and end items included in the military services' approved five-year defense program. Army officials stated that designs for mobilization projects could have been completed for the highest priority mobilization projects if they had known at least 2 years ago that additional funding would be provided for them. Thus, while the Congress provided funding to address mobilization production base deficiencies, the Army had not On the other identified the most critically needed facilities. 5

The Army's fiscal year 1987 budget request included (1) $161.1 million to partially address mobilization base deficiencies ($145.6 million for 10 facility projects and $15.5 million for designing mobilization production base facilities) and (2) $120.1 million in support of the planned peacetime ammunition procurement program ($103.9 million for 10 facility projects and $16.2 million for design work), facility As of February 1986, 5 of the 10 mobilization projects requiring designs ($102.8 million of the requested $145.6 million) had no designs completed.

As agreed, to identify ammunition production base problems, Ammunition Production Base we used the Army's February 27, 1984, Study and other studies by the Army, GAO, and others on the We then reviewed the Army's initiatives to ammunition base. address reported production base problems and discussed with OSD officials an ongoing OSD study concerning how to accelerate the production base for critical items. We also asked Army and OSD officials for their views on production base problems and actions that could be undertaken in fiscal year 1987 to begin correcting critical mobilization production base problems. We million existing for the request deficiencies. reviewed the development of Army programs to use $103.1 for fiscal year 1986 to correct provided by the Congress mobilization base deficiencies and supporting material $161.1 million in the Army's fiscal year 1987 budget for projects to partially address mobilization

We discussed our results with OSD and Army officials directly responsible for maintaining the ammunition production base and have incorporated their comments where warranted. However, we did not obtain official agency comments. We conducted our review at the Office of the Secretary of Washington, D.C.: the Army's Office of Deputy Chief of Defense, Staff for Research, Development and Acquisition, Washington, Army Armament, Munitions, and Chemical Command, the U.S. D.C.; Rock Island, Illinois: and the U.S. Army Production Base We performed our work Modernization Activity, Dover, New Jersey. from February to August 1986 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
