The Honorable John Conyers, Jr. Chairman, Legislation and National Security Subcommittee Committee on Government Operations House of Representatives Dear Mr. Chairman: As you requested, we reviewed federal agencies'implementation of classified information nondisclosure agreements, including Standard Form 312 and Form 4355, and prepublication reviews of employee manuscripts and other submissions that might contain classified information. Specifically, we obtained data on (1) the number and the cost of nondisclosure agreements executed by federal and contractor employees, (2) the number and the cost of prepublication reviews performed by federal agencies, and (3) the expenditures made by the Information Security Oversight Office to implement Standard Form 312.

Background

States against unauthorized disclosure of classified national security information, have been in existence for many years. Their use did not become policy until 1983, when the President issued National Security Decision Directive 84, which, among its requirements, directed the Information Security Oversight Office to develop standardized agreements. Executive Order 12356, effective August 1, 1982, prescribed a uniform system for classifying, declassifying, and safeguarding national security information. It recognizes that it is essential that the public be informed of the activities of its government, but that the interest of the United States and its citizens require that certain national defense and foreign relations information be protected against unauthorized disclosure. The executive order assigns the Director, Information Security Oversight Office, responsibility for developing governmentwide directives for implementing the order. Classified information nondisclosure agreements have long been a source of controversy. Their use has raised complex questions about such issues as the President' s ability to protect national security information, the Congress'ability to obtain the information it needs to oversee federal agencies, and an individual' s right to free speech. Use of

these agreements has been restricted by the Congress through legislation and challenged by Members of Congress and unions representing government employees in courts of law. In a recent case, a United States District Court genera.lly sustained the government' s use of nondisclosure agreements for federal employees with access to classified information. It also, however, found unconstitutional nondisclosure forms whose prohibitions were overly broad. Of the 54 federal agencies that received your questionnaire, 48 responded that government and contractor employees signed about 144,000 and 98,000 nondisclosure agreements, respectively, between October 1, 1989, and March 31, 1990. According to the agencies, their costs to implement the signing of these agreements during this 6-month period were about $433,000 for government employees and about $12,000 for contractor employees. The 48 agencies reported that government and contractor employees signed about 338,000 and 1,279,OOO nondisclosure agreements, respectively, during 1988. They reported that government employees signed about 241,000 agreements and contractor employees signed about 176,000 agreements in 1989. The total number of nondisclosure agreements signed between 1984 and 1989 is shown in figure 1.

The dramatic increases in nondisclosure agreements signed by government employees in 1986 and 1987, and by contractor employees in 1988 were the result of efforts to meet December 31, 1987 and 1988 deadlines for having all employees requiring accessto classified information to sign the agreements. These deadlines were established by the Information Security Oversight Office in December 1984. The 48 agencies reported that they conducted about 10,000 prepublication reviews during the 6-month period at a cost of about $750,000. The Information Security Oversight Office estimated that it spent about $402,000 to implement the Standard Form 312 from the form' s inception in *June 1988 through mid-October 1990. Of this amount, about $276,000 was for the salaries of Oversight Office employees who worked on the form and about $126,000 was for developing, printing, publishing, duplicating, and distributing training aids for implementing the form.

Scopeand Methodology

We compiled the results of a questionnaire on classified information nondisclosure agreements and prepublication review activities that you sent to 64 agencies that handle classified information. The resulting information includes actual figures, as well as estimates where actual data were not available, from the 48 agencies that responded. We did not verify the information reported by the agencies. We also obtained information on the Information Security Oversight Office' s expenditures to implement the Standard Form 312. As you requested, we did not obtain agency comments on this fact sheet. Unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this fact sheet until 30 days from its issue date. At that time, we will send copies to all agencies that provided information. Copies will also be made available to others on request. Appendix I lists the questionnaire recipients, appendix II provides a more detailed discussion of nondisclosure agreements; appendix III provides more details on agencies'responses to your questionnaire; and appendix IV, as you requested, provides examples of nondisclosure agreement forms. An agency by agency breakdown of all data reported will be provided in a separate report. This fact sheet was prepared under the direction of Victor Zangla, Assistant Director, Logistics Issues; Donald H. Lentz, Evaluator-in-Charge, Logistics Issues; and Irving T. Boker, Adviser, Logistics Issues. Please contact me on (202) 275-8412 if you or your staff have any questions. Sincerely yours,

The Use of NondisclosureAgreements

Nondisclosure agreements are intended to protect the United States against unauthorized disclosure of classified national security information, The agreements are to be in a form determined by the Justice Department to be enforceable in a civil action brought by the United States in a court of law. AI1 government and contractor employees are required to sign a nondisclosure agreement as a condition of access to classified information. Nondisclosure agreements have been in use for many years; however, the President did not make them a formal policy until March 1983, when he issued National Security Decision Directive 84. National Security Decision Directive 84 requires each executive branch agency that originates or handles classified information to adopt internal procedures to safeguard against unlawful disclosure of classified information. At a minimum, these agencies should require each person with authorized access to (1) classified information to sign a nondisclosure agreement as a condition of access and (2) Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI)' to sign a nondisclosure agreement with a prepublication review provision as a condition of access to SCI. The directive also requires the Information Security Oversight Office to develop standardized nondisclosure agreements. Various agencies use different nondisclosure forms. In response to the 1983 directive, the Oversight Office issued Standard Form 189 in September 1983 for use by government employees and Standard Form 189-A in November 1986 for use by contractor employees. The Director, Central Intelligence adopted the agency' s existing Form 4193, which had been in use since 1981, as the nondisclosure agreement for persons with authorized access to SCI. The Department of Defense uses DD Form 1847-1 as its nondisclosure agreement for SCI. SCI nondisclosure agreements contain a prepublication review provision to assure deletion of SCI and other classified information from materials prepared for public disclosure. Although the President suspended the directive' s prepublication review provision in February 1984, employees were still required to sign a Form 4193 or DD Form 1847-1 as a condition of access to SCI. Other government agencies require specialized agreements to be signed before granting access to the government' s non-%1 special access programs.2
` SC1 includes all information and materials requiring special controls indicating restricted handling within present and future intelligence collection programs and their end products. "A special accessprogram requires need-to-know or accesscontrols beyond those normally required for accessto confidential, secret, or top secret information.

Appendix II The Use of Nondisclosure

Agreements

In December 1987, the Congress included language prohibiting the continued use of Standard Form 189 and Form 4193 in the "Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1988." Section 630 of the act states that No funds appropriated in this or any other act for fiscal year 1988 may be used to implement or enforce the agreements in Standard Form 189 and Form 4193 of the Government or any other nondisclosure policy, form, or agreement if such policy, form, or agreement: (1) concerns information other than that specifically marked as classified; or, unmarked but known by the employee to be classified; or, unclassified but known by the employee to be in the process of classification determination; (2) contains the term "classifiable;" (3) directly or indirectly obstructs, by requirement of prior written authorization, limitation of authorized disclosure, or otherwise, the right of any individual to petition or communicate with Members of Congress in a secure manner as provided by the rules and procedures of Congress; (4) interferes with the right of the Congress to obtain executive branch information in a secure manner as provided by the rules and procedures of Congress; (5) imposes any obligations or invokes any remedies inconsistent with statutory law; provided, that nothing in this section shall affect the enforcement of those aspects of such nondisclosure policy, form, or agreement that do not fall within subsection (l)-(5) of this section. Appropriations bills passed in September 1988 and November 1989 contain essentially the same language. In response to the December 1987 legislation, the Oversight Office instructed government agencies to stop using Standard Forms 189 and 189-A until further notice. The legality of nondisclosure agreements has also been challenged in court. A principal issue is the constitutional conflict between the executive branch' s obligation to safeguard national security information and the individual' s right to freedom of speech under the U.S. Constitution. In May 1988, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled
that section 630 impermissibly restricted the President from fulfilling

Agreements

his express obligations under the U.S. Constitution and from exercising his role in foreign relations.3 In July 1988, in the same case, the court generally sustained the government' s use of nondisclosure agreements for employees with access to classified information. The court found, however, that federal employees who had signed agreements not to disclose information "classifiable" had to be provided either (1) a copy of the Information Security Oversight Office' s definition of "classifiable" or (2) a notice that the term "classifiable" was stricken from all agreements. The court held that without a definition, the term "classifiable" was far too broad to satisfy the constitutional requirement that free speech be restrained no more than is necessary.4 In September 1988, the Oversight Office replaced Standard Form 189 and 189-A with Standard Form 312 and lifted its moratorium on the signing of nondisclosure agreements. The most significant difference between Standard Form 189 and Standard Form 312 is in the way "classified information" is defined. Standard Form 189 defined classified information as information that is either classified or classifiable under the standards of Executive Order 12356. The word classifiable was excluded from Standard Form 312 to comply with the court decision. The Oversight Office also advised government agencies to notify employees of the deletion of the word classifiable from signed copies of Standard Form 189. This also prompted (1) the Central Intelligence Agency to delete the word classifiable from Form 4193 and reissue it as Form 4355 and (2) the Department of Defense to delete the word classifiable from DD Form 1847-1. The Congress has included language in the "Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, lQQl", enacted on November 5, 1990, that is intended to eliminate the nondisclosure agreement controversy. Section 617 of the act contains a provision to be added to Standard Form 312 and Form 4355 that limits how the forms may be used. The purpose of the addition is to assure that the restrictions in nondisclosure policies, forms, and agreements do not supersede,
3This ruling was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, In April 1989, the Supreme Court returned this ruling to the District Court since the term "classifiable" had been deleted from all nondisclosure forms and other parts of the case were best left to the District Court for resolution. 4The July ruling was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. That court returned the case to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court' s April 1989 ruling. Subsequently, these cases were greatly simplified.
