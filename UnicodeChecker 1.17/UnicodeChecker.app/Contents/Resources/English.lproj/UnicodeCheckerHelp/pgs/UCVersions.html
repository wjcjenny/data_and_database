<li> Added the optional parameter “named entities” to the AppleScript command “XHTML representation of” for selecting whether named entities should be used (the default) when available for a codepoint or not.</li>
<li> The last codepoint inside a character block would not be displayed as belonging to its character block. This has been fixed.</li>
<li> In IDNA conversion: Strings with leading separators (i.e. dots) would have the separators in the wrong places after conversion. This has been fixed.</li>
<li> In IDNA-Utility: Display or non-display of warning message “Contains codepoint unassigned in nameprep” below the conversion output fields could have been wrong. This has been fixed.</li>
