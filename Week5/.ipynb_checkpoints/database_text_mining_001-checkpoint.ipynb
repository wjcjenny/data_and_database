I fear that the language of the report could have unintended consequences for the on-going efforts to modernize the National Security Agency. The report mandates that the NSA manage its modernization effort as though it were a traditional major defense acquisition program. If this mandate were applied to each of the individual technology efforts within the NSA, such a requirement could impede NSA's flexibility to modernize and upgrade its capabilities. I would ask the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee whether this was the Committee's intent?\"],\n",

Let's assume there is the country of Xanadu and an American is meeting with the President of Xanadu. In all probability, an American official is meeting with the President of Xanadu. The National Security Agency--with the ability to intercept conversations by multiple methods--picks up a conversation, or somebody's report of a conversation, between an American and the President of Xanadu. That gets reported back, based on subject matter, to the appropriate officer within the State Department or the Defense Department who they feel should know about this conversation because maybe the President said to the American: You know, we have right here in our country 47 al-Qaida operatives. That should go to the person who has that responsibility.\",\n",

He would get these NSA, National Security Agency, intercept reports.

       "   u'speaking': [u'Mr. President, 2 years ago the American people first became aware that the National Security Agency was collecting private information about their phone calls. This is called the Snowden revelation. ',\n",
       "    u'Under the banner of national security, the National Security Agency was mining information about home phone calls and how long they lasted. They found out whom they were calling--and not only that. They found out whom the call was between. They also determined how long that call lasted.',\n",
       "    u'NSA essentially was conducting a dragnet, without first attempting to determine whether that information was relevant to a national security problem. NSA ran this program under the authorities granted to them by section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, which expires on June 1 of this year. The American people were outraged by these revelations and Congress rightly acted.',\n",
       "    u\"Last year, the House passed a bill by a vote of 303 to 121 to end the NSA's so-called bulk metadata collection program and reform and extend the authority for this program.\",\n",
       "    u'I brought a similar bill to the floor authored by Senators Leahy and Lee. There was a bipartisan group of Senators who joined them to call for its passage. But sadly, the majority leader--at that time the minority leader--stood in the way of bipartisan reform. Instead of passing meaningful reform, he led a Republican filibuster of this bill. That was one of a couple hundred that was led by my friend.',\n",
       "    u\"This year, Senators Leahy and Lee worked again with the Chairman and ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee on the USA FREEDOM Act, which ends the National Security Agency's bulk collection program and extends and reforms the authorities under section 215 of the PATRIOT Act.\",\n",
       "    u\"There have been bipartisan and bicameral calls for the Senate to take up that legislation. Yet again, instead of committing to bringing up this bipartisan bill, last month the senior Senator from Kentucky introduced a bill that would extend the authorities for the National Security Agency's bulk collection program for 5\\\\1/2\\\\ years. Then the Second Circuit, almost simultaneously--within 24 hours of that decision by the majority leader--found the bulk collection illegal.\",\n",
       "    u\"In reaction to the court's decision, the House last week passed the USA FREEDOM Act by a vote of 338 to 88. By a four-to-one margin, the House voted to end the National Security Agency's illegal bulk data collection program and reform its practices.\",\n",
       "    u\"But even in the face of that court's decision, the majority leader stood once again against bipartisan reform. Instead of heeding the Republican-controlled House's calls for reform, the majority leader introduced a bill that would extend the authorities for the National Security Agency's illegal program for 2 more months.\",\n",
       "    u'Congressman Goodlatte, the chair of the Judiciary Committee in the House, said they will not accept a short-term extension of the bill. This morning, Leader McCarthy, the second ranking Republican in the House, said they will not accept any extension. That is exactly what the Speaker, Congressman Boehner, said.',\n",
       "    u'If we squander this opportunity to deliver sound reforms to this illegal program, we are handling our duties irresponsibly here in the Senate.',\n",
       "    u'To stand in the way of reforming these practices is to ignore the voice of the American people. Just yesterday, a new poll commissioned by the American Civil Liberties Union showed that 82 percent of Americans are concerned that the Federal Government is collecting and storing the personal information of Americans, and they do not like it.',\n",
       "    u\"If we are unable to reform these practices, we are ignoring the ruling of the Second Circuit, which rejected the National Security Agency's bulk collection program, and we are not allowing the American people's voice to be heard.\",\n",
       "    u'I think, most importantly, if the senior Senator from Kentucky does not allow this commonsense reform simply with a vote on the Senate floor about what happened in the House, they are ignoring the rare bipartisan support that we have.',\n",
       "    u\"Just last week, 190 House Republicans voted to end the National Security Agency's illegal program. There is bipartisan consensus in favor of ending this program. Many of the Republican leader's own colleagues have called for it as well.\",\n",
       "    u'Last week, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, wrote a letter to Senator Leahy, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Both the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence voiced their support for the USA FREEDOM Act, saying:',\n",
       "    u'Overall, the significant reforms contained in this legislation will provide the public greater confidence in how our intelligence activities are carried out and in the oversight of those activities, while ensuring vital national security authorities remain in place.',\n",
       "    u'I agree with that statement. But sadly, the majority leader continues to stand in the way of bipartisan reform to end these illegal practices. As we face the June 1 expiration of these authorities, the majority leader still offers no viable alternative.',\n",
       "    u'We cannot allow this program to be extended. The majority leader should listen to the American people because we cannot extend an illegal act. That is what the majority leader is asking us to do.',\n",
       "    u'The majority leader should listen to the American people, consider the action of his Republican colleagues, and respect the expertise of the intelligence community.',\n",
       "    u'The Senate should act now on the USA FREEDOM Act before it leaves for the Memorial Day recess and restore the confidence of the American people.'],\n",

       "    u\"Whereas on June 22, 2006, news organizations publicly disclosed the existence of an ongoing, highly classified national security program to track terrorists' financial transactions, known formally as the ``Terrorist Finance Tracking Program''; Whereas the President condemned the unauthorized leak and subsequent publication in the strongest possible terms, calling those acts ``disgraceful'' and explaining that public disclosure of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program ``does great harm to the United States of America''; Whereas the Secretary of the Treasury noted that this unauthorized leak of classified information and subsequent publication ``undermined a highly successful counter- terrorism program and alerted terrorists to the methods and sources used to track their money trails''; Whereas similar to the leaks and public disclosure of the National Security Agency's Terrorist Surveillance Program, the disclosure of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program puts America's terrorist enemies on notice of tactics used to hunt them down and makes defending against further terrorist attacks more difficult; Whereas Administration officials and the co-chairmen of the 9/11 Commission (a Democrat and a Republican) urged news organizations to refrain from publicly disclosing the existence of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program because of the probable harm to America's national security; Whereas there have been no credible allegations of abuse or infringements on civil liberties in the execution of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program; Whereas the 9/11 Commission in its Final Report concluded that ``information about terrorist money helps us to understand their networks, search them, and disrupt their operations''; Whereas the 9/11 Commission had given the Administration high marks in its pursuit of terrorist-finance networks, and recommended that ``vigorous efforts to track terrorist financing must remain front and center in U.S. counter-terrorism efforts''; and Whereas the United States must remain vigilant in its War on Terror: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That-- (1) the Senate joins the President in condemning the damaging leaks and subsequent publication of vital national security information about the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program and the National Security Agency's Terrorist Surveillance Program; and (2) it is the sense of the Senate that the Department of Justice should vigorously and tirelessly investigate and prosecute any and all persons responsible for the unauthorized disclosure to news organizations of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, the National Security Agency's Terrorist Surveillance Program, and other vital counter-terrorism programs.\"],\n",

He has distinguished himself and the National Security Agency in positions of increasing responsibility. Mr. Jacobs capped his illustrious career as the Information Assurance Director of the National Security Agency.',\n",
       "    u\"Mr. Jacobs is an outstanding example of the many dedicated public servants who fulfill critical needs, often without public recognition. When Mr. Jacobs joined the NSA, the agency's existence was a secret. While the American people now know and appreciate more about the NSA, most of the attention goes to signals intelligence.\",\n",
       "    u\"Mr. Jacobs made his mark fulfilling the NSA's other core mission: information assurance. He has led and shaped the essential effort to develop secure information systems. Our Presidents, our Armed Forces, our diplomats, our intelligence agencies, and other Government leaders depend on secure communications every day. During his tenure, Mr. Jacobs has shaped every part of how our government addresses the Information Assurance needs.\",\n",
       "    u'Mr. Jacobs demonstrated a real commitment to the long-range needs of America. His initiatives in research and education are key examples. He worked to sustain the Information Assurance Awareness and Training and Education Research Program. He also broke new ground in establishing NSA Centers of Excellence in Information Assurance Education at institutions of higher learning in Maryland and across the country.',\n",
       "    u\"Mr. Jacobs was stayed ahead of the curve in protecting America's critical information infrastructure. The White House recognized the Information Assurance System Security Education and Training Program (NIEPT) he developed as a model in Government.\",\n",
       "    u\"Mr. Jacobs' embodies the best traditions of our civil service. That's why he has been recognized with the NSA Exceptional Civilian Service Award and the National Intelligence Medal of Achievement.\",\n",
       "    u'As the Senator from Maryland and a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I want to thank Mr. Jacobs for his dedication to the United States of America. He has served our nation with honor. I wish Mike well as he enters a new phase of his life. '],\n",

       "    u\"Section 506 authorizes the National Security Agency (NSA) security protective officers to exercise their law enforcement functions 500 feet beyond the confines of NSA facilities. At present, NSA's protective jurisdiction does not extend beyond the territorial bounds of its perimeter fences. Additionally, NSA has to rely on several federal, state, and local jurisdictions to respond to threats that occur just outside its fence line. With so many jurisdictions involved, there is a chance that a necessary response could be slowed and thus ineffective. In addition, under current law (Section 11 of the National Security Agency Act of 1959) the Administrator of General Services, upon the application of the Director of NSA, may provide for the protection of those facilities that are under the control of or use by the National Security Agency. The General Services Administration has delegated this authority to NSA. This amendment to the National Security Agency Act would provide NSA with the organic authority needed to protect its facilities and personnel without having to obtain a delegation of authority from the General Services Administration. This section parallels authority the Central Intelligence Agency currently has in section 15 of the CIA Act of 1949 (50 U.S.C. 403o). The attacks of September 11, 2001 demonstrated the growing threat of terrorism in the United States. The conferees believe the NSA's authority to have a protective detail should be clarified and enhanced 500 feet beyond the confines of NSA's facilities, but were sensitive to the public's reaction to an unlimited grant of law enforcement jurisdiction outside NSA's borders. Therefore, the exercise of this new authority is expressly limited to only those circumstances where NSA security protective officers can identify specific and articulable facts giving them reason to believe that the exercise of this authority is necessary to protect against physical damage or injury to NSA installations, property, or employees. This provision also expressly states that the rules and regulations prescribed by the Director of the NSA for agency property and installations do not extend into the 500 foot area established by this provision. Thus, there will be no restrictions, for example, on the taking of photographs within the 500 foot zone. The conferees do not envision a general grant of police authority in the 500 foot zone, but do envision NSA security protective officers functioning as federal police, for limited purposes, within the 500 foot zone with all attendant authorities, capabilities, immunities, and liabilities. The conferees expect the Director of NSA to coordinate and establish Memoranda of Understanding with all federal, state, or local law enforcement agencies with which NSA will exercise concurrent jurisdiction in the 500 foot zones. The Director of NSA shall submit such Memoranda of Understanding to the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Armed Services Committee of the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives. The Director of NSA is also expected to develop a training plan to familiarize the Agency's security protective officers with their new authorities and responsibilities. The Director of NSA shall submit such plan to the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Armed Services Committee of the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives not later than 30 days after the enactment of this provision. Section 506 also includes a reporting requirement so that the intelligence committees may closely scrutinize the exercise of this new authority. Items Not Included Section 306 of the House bill contained a provision establishing, with respect to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, a federal commission on the national security readiness of the United States. The Senate bill had no similar provision. The House recedes.\"],\n",

We now know that the National Security Agency (NSA) is keeping a phone log of all calls made in the U.S. This issue merits heightened congressional scrutiny. We need to strike a balance between our efforts to prevent terrorist attacks and our protection of civil liberties. The committees with jurisdiction are conducting a thorough review--as they should. I look forward to hearing their recommendations.',\n",
       "    u'That said, rewriting laws--especially one that NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander says is vital to our safety--is not within the scope of the appropriations process. I welcome further discussion about the scope and intent of the PATRIOT Act, and look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that the law is not overly broad. So though I commend Mr. Amash for raising this issue, I must respectfully vote against his amendment.'],\n",

       "u\"Mr. Speaker, the Electronic Surveillance Modernization Act, H.R. 5825, seeks to expand the administration's power by giving the President greater flexibility over a program that he has already abused. If our experience with this administration proves anything, it is that reducing congressional oversight would be a mistake.Less than a year ago the American public learned how the president had blatantly disregarded the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by authorizing a warrantless eavesdropping program on American citizens. After this program was uncovered, we discovered that the administration had authorized the National Security Agency to build a massive phone records database. Now the President asks that we pass legislation to legitimatize illegal activities that have already occurred and the current Republican leadership is all too willing to comply.This legislation does not solve any problems or make our country more secure, it simply grants the administration the authority to implement more programs that violate the civil rights and liberties of American citizens.We must hold this administration accountable for its actions and not retroactively approve an illegal program. Surveillance activities must be done consistent with our Constitution and our laws, and should protect both the American people and our freedoms.\""

       "u\"Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 5825, the Electronic Surveillance Modernization Act.The bill before us today allows this Administration to continue its program of unwarranted surveillance of Americans, in direct violation of the rights guaranteed to us by the Constitution and by statute. Mr. Speaker, proponents of this legislation claim that there is no violation or question about the program's legality. If that is, in fact, the case, then why are we considering legislation with the sole purpose of legalizing the President's, and the NSA's, actions?Last December, we learned that President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to spy domestically, without obtaining any warrants. Since that time, we have learned very little about the program, largely due to the Administration's unwillingness to properly inform Congress about the programs components, scope, or its budget. The little we do know, however, is that through this program, hundreds, and possibly thousands, of Americans have had their telephone conversations and emails monitored without any judicial supervision. The Majority has failed in its oversight responsibilities. Nevertheless, we are preparing to pass legislation that legitimizes this little understood, but still extremely troubling program.H.R. 5825 allows the President to authorize warrantless surveillance of communications of ordinary Americans without first obtaining approval from the FISA court. They say they need this because our laws are out of date. This is false and untrue.Current law (FISA) allows the President to act in emergencies and when there is a declaration of war by Congress. The proponents have not come forward with evidence that the current law is not working or failing to protect us.Congress must use the checks and balances placed in our Constitution to curb the Administration's actions. Congress needs to assert its oversight responsibility and fully evaluate this NSA program. And the Administration needs to stop its attempts to extend its power and authority, at every available opportunity, by circumventing our nation's laws. Despite what this Administration would have us believe, securing our nation from all enemies both foreign and domestic can be achieved without violations of our civil liberties and right to privacy. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this misguided and ill-advised legislation.\""

Thus, we may believe that naturally occurring data sets contain structure, that EDA is a useful vehicle for revealing the structure. . . . If we make no attempt to check whether the structure could have arisen by chance, and tend to accept the findings as gospel, then the ritual comes close to magical thinking. ... a controlled form of magical thinking--in the guise of 'working hypothesis'--is a basic ingredient of scientific progress. \n",
