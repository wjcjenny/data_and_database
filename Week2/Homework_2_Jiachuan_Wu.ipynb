    "In the cell below, I've defined a string in a variable called `start`. Your task is to write an expression (or series of statements) that creates a new string, which contains the character with the *next* ASCII value for each character in the string. For example, if you start with `\"abc\"`, you should end up with `\"bcd\"`: the ASCII value of `a` is 97, so the next ASCII character is `b` (98).\n",
    "\n",
    "> As a reminder: the `ord()` function returns the numerical ASCII value of a given character. (E.g., `ord('x')` evaluates to 120.) The `chr()` function does the converse: given an integer value, it returns the ASCII character corresponding to that value. (E.g., `chr(120)` evaluates to `'x'`)\n",
